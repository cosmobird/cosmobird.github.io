  		<h3>Experience</h3>
  		<p>
  			This is not like any other book for me. It is a fact that my family have spend a laaaaaarge sum amount of money to make
  			me earn a degree in engineering. I completed my Undergraduate in Electronics and Communication with very little knowledge
  			if at all anybody can sympathize on it, but with a hell lot of questions lingering in mind creating a deep hollow hell
  			hole craving for actual knowledge. Luckily, my father seems to be a studious guy in his University days (those days really
  			did atleast seem to have some stuff for knowledge), and i started reading the books he got as winning prizes in his days.
  			One of them is <b>Entertaining Electronics</b> book. Eventhough, this book was lying around for 22 years i have not given
  			much important to it.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Just finishing my Undergraduate with my love for comics, this book took me to peaks of surprise ! My brain got hit by
  			storm of cleaning from this single book which not even a book in my college have provided me. I really tried to learn
  			from them - what is the use if fundas are broken with me ? So Yes, this is one of those awesome books which give us the
  			travel experience by which we will not even feel time going by. I guess lot of my learning on comics also inspired by
  			this book.
  		</p>

  		<h3>What can one learn ?</h3>
  		<p>
  			It will be useful for all those who fall ill of our universities and educational institutions. So instead of keeping it
  			with myself i have decided to share. Please take the book and reshare with all of your friends.

  			<ul>
  				<li>Are you new to Electronics ?</li>
  				<li>Want to know What are Electrons ?</li>
  				<li>Want to understand Waves ?</li>
  				<li>Are you the one among who is confused by anologies ?</li>
  				<li>Want a new dimension of understanding Electronics ?</li>
  				<li>Could not approach Communication ?</li>
  				<li>Interested in learning how to tell a story, concept ?</li>
  				<li>Learning how to draw scientific-comic or techno-comic ?</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p style="text-align:center">
  			Then this book is for you. <mark>Go on <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2P66bYnyzH7NFlEUklBbHhPdzA">Download it.</a></mark>
  		</p>

  		<h3>Triumph</h3>
  		<p>
  			It is sad that the publisher is no more. But luckily internet saved the books by collecting from the readers like you
  			and me around the world. Check out all of the mir publisher books <a href="https://mirtitles.org/">Mirtitles community</a>.
  			I tried to legally apply a copyleft license by digitizing this and applying for gutenberg, which is still not completed.
  			Sorry for that. <mark>My friend and peer Niranjan Bharathi has helped me very much</mark> in converting the hard copy into
  			digital pdf which took hours and earned his arm pains. <b>But the book is worth it</b>. I will soon contribute the book to
  			Mirtitles asap. However sorry for the delay :), i am mourning for losing hard copy of the book.... very recently. I believe
  			i can find it again.
  		</p>

  		<h3>To Do:</h3>
  		<p>
  			<ol>
  				<li>Either publish it through gutenberg or internet archive</li>
  				<li>Or share it through Mirtitles</li>
  			</ol>
