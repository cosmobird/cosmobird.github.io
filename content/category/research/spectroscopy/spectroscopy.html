  	  	<p>Hello there <b>!</b></p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLIAMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	This is not a full fledged tutorial or history on spectroscopy and its awesomeness, rather i would
  	  		only like to share what i have learned, interpreted and understood in my experience and exploration.
  	  		The following contents might subject to change with my change in knowledge and further experience.
  	  	</p>

	| subjective views !	     |

  		<h3>Why am i writing this ?</h3>
  		<p>
			I feel that even though spectroscopy along with the rise of optics, telescopy, radio, space exploration, material science,
  			food science, etc.... have penetrated deeper and wider into laboratories of massive institutions and instrument manufacturers,
  			it is been widely not democratized like any other awesome scientific instruments available. This article can be seen as a
  			template of a instrumentation engineer and lover, who screams about non-democratizing attitude of scientists, laboratory
  			engineers and instrument makers, and its associated knowledge sharing model, business model, etc... Apart from that, i would
  			generally explore and explain what i have learned and what are all the potential ideas that i have interpreted for the past
  			4+ years.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Even with so much little experience with spectroscopy and associated fields, i could come up with few awesome ideas,
  			that are pragmatic and at the same time felt the necessity for democratizing it, like few other people here and there
  			in the science and technology realm. One thing that still amuses me, is why cant former, <i>"wiser"</i>, better experienced
  			engineers, scientists, developers, interns, students, could democratize it ?

  			<ul>
  				<li>Is it a stigma among them <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it the public & perish thing <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it the patent systems <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it the economic & business models <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it they dont look at real problems <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it they work only for organization benefit <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it they just do their "job" <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it because they are isolated <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it because, mind bogged down by the complexity <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it, they have lost their <b>explorative</b> spirit <b>?</b></li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Personally, i like spectroscopy next to bicycling & bicycles. For me it is next awesome thing at equal to bicycles.
  			I love both of them and i read somebody quoting a similar thing in some book. However, i have always had it close
  			to my heart. It helped me to better understand about electromagnetics, wave propagation, mass - energy interaction,
  			and other awesome stuff that deal with energy & mass in physics. Even though when i am not good in math and programming,
  			this love have made me learn about many things which i am previously completely ignorant about. Somehow, it has
  			made me an anti-ignorant and made me more rational. I am fortunate, that i have worked with good mentor & colleagues
  			in a public laboratory. They have supported me morally, & economiclly, eventhough when we had debates and fights on
  			some stuff. On the whole, i learned a lot theoretically, but only less than that pragmatically.
  		</p>

  		<h3>What is Spectroscopy actually ?</h3>
  		<p>
  			It is all about understanding one of the fundamental energy form of nature - the <b>electromagnetic energy</b>. Specifically
  			the subject completely devotes to understand the interaction of energy with the mass, which together constitutes all
  			the elements of nature. Yes it deals a lot with quantum physics and electromagnetic wave theory, why materials behave in a
  			certain way when they interact with EM energy, what are the explainable reasons behind it etc. For a brief introduction
  			about spectroscopy, check out <a href="../../../../htmls/presentations.html">presentation</a> section on it. For me, it
  			started with <b>why food tasted, coloured and smelled so ?</b>, what is the scientific reason behind it ? why to explore it ?
  			how to explain it to my folks about it ? These questions have driven be partly crazy and partly rational.
  		</p>

  		<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/comics/spectroscopy/electromagnetic_spectrum.png" alt="em-spectrum">
  	  	  	<figcaption>Electromagnetic Spectrum in XKCD's view</figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  		<p>
  			Simply any phenomenon which have a periodic pattern of change that can be represented as a wave can be measured in terms of
  			frequency and with collection of bunch of frequency we have a spectrum. The spectrum can be measured by a number of
  			means that varies depending upon the energy we are dealing with. The thing about electromagnetic spectrum however, is that
  			they are omnipresent. They present wherever matter is.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Soon, i have realized that spectroscopy is not just related with food, and my world view have significant changed from
  			entity & reduction oriented towards connection and holistic relations. May be because of my expansion of understanding and
  			interpretation critically changed. It had a rich history like any other field in science, and i have finally could
  			feel the non-reductionist approach in understanding science and started asking deeper questions myself. This while
  			keeping part of me deeply abstract, while at the same time, other part of me deeply tied with reality around me.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Ideas to solve problems that i felt, through spectroscopy started populating in my head. Without any proper means of
  			expressing it, they started clouding. I couldn't understand why the system mandates a Ph.D to innovate and discover
  			something scientific. I believe, that science is science no matter the academic degree one possess. I felt deprivation
  			of liberty and freedom in it. But my love of spectroscopy have never decreased and infact encouraged me to pursue
  			my own research independently, even if i am miserably going to fail.
  		</p>

  		<h3>Instruments</h3>

  		<p>
  			Instruments in association with spectroscopy are diversed, and vary widely in their design, construction, because of various
  			technological constraints. There is no signle instrument that could cover the whole electromagnetic spectrum. There cannot
  			exist a single ship with which we shall explore all of the ocean. These instruments were grouped based on the spectrum
  			they are capable to explore. Within each group, several types of instruments were innovated with varying architectures and
  			design. Thus a <b>Spectrometer</b> in general is an instrument that measures the spectrum - a part of electromagnetic
  			spectrum. It is also called as <b>Spectrophotometer</b> when the instrumentation is designed based on counting the photons
  			within the chosen spectrum. All of these instruments tend to derive quantities from the measured status of the spectrum
  			sensed from a particular material in terms of wavelength of the electromagnetic wave (could be visible light, IR, UV, X-ray,
  			Radio...).
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Many derived quantities & applications are possible, such as:

  			<ul>
  				<li>Distance</li>
  				<li>Density</li>
  				<li>Concentration</li>
  				<li>Vegetation</li>
  				<li>Temperature</li>
  				<li>Colour</li>
  				<li>Mass</li>
  				<li>Molecular Structure</li>
  				<li>Communication Channel</li>
  				<li>Aerial & Satellite imaging</li>
  				<li>...</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<h3>Democratization</h3>
  		<p>
  			Whether it is wave based or photon count based, these instruments are essential for a range of requirements such as
  			planetary exploration, mineral evaluation, material study, food inspection, ... spanning widest range of fields. Even
  			with its spread and penetration, democratization effect is very very less. Most of the instrument design are patented,
  			which have devasted the democratizing effect. Patent & Copyright systems, have made it sure that the design stay within
  			the manufacturer control, which further hanged the propagation of knowledge required to make such useful instruments
  			to the people. Whether it is possible to create an instrument or not by the commons, it is not a scientific process, to
  			block the propagation of knowledge just becuase something is not practically possible.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Right after 2009, with the evolution of Free Hardware, Open Data, Open Access evolution, following & adapting a similar
  			philosophy from the Free Software evolution, a few of the projects by some of the communities and individuals are
  			contributed for designing a spectrometer. While scientists and engineers who have worked for years in making such
  			instruments especially in space programs have not made their designs transparent, pointing their reasons to "confidential
  			matters" & "patents". Some of the recent projects which have a goal towards in making such instruments are :

  			<ul>
  				<li><a href="http://myspectral.com/">Spectruino</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry">Public Spectrometer</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/1279">Raman Pi, by fl@c@</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/12335">David H Haffner Sr's</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/10738-ottervis-lgl-spectrophotometer">Otter VIS by Esben Rossel</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/4141">Microspectrometer by Pure engineering</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/12724">Adam's</a></li>
  				<li><a href="http://opennirs.org/">Open NIRS</a></li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Still DIY community and hackers projects like the above are still a long way when compared to the commercially available
  			ones that have occupied scientific laboratories. One reason, is that these laboratories have stopped making their own
  			instruments - <b>kind of laziness</b> and started procuring proprietary instruments & devices - <b>imprisoned knowledge</b>.
  			DIY individuals & Community projects are still great way of making their instruments transparent, available and accessible
  			to commons with suitable propagatable licenses. However, availability of necessary infrastructure of peer production,
  			are not available in many places around the world - primarily because of the lack of awareness about the idea of <b>peer
  			production</b> itself. With designs being shared and improved collaboratively using internet and collaborative platforms
  			built on it, it is very likely that the quality of these instruments will surely be improved & will surpass the performance
  			and quality of "commercial & proprietary" ones.
  		</p>

  		<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/comics/spectroscopy/purity.png" alt="purity-fight">
  	  	  	<figcaption>Fight for Purity !</figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  		<p>
  			Democratization is not only effective in designs of such instruments, but also it protects the violation of data derived
  			from them. Previously, even with proprietary instruments they are mechanisms that are imposed by the manufacturers, who
  			control the data measured by instrument in the user's field. These manufacturers have started providing data and information
  			based service through internet - illustrating as a perfect reason to further reduce the scientists', engineers', spectroscopists'
  			work. Thus this shows the relation between monopolization of knowledge by patenting the design and imprisoning the information.
  			I believe with open systems in science and technology, soon the instruments will be widely available to commons.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Soon commons deserve to do science. It will be progressive in reality when science is done by commons than by paid and honoured
  			scientists who would work for money under a organizations fund, signed with non-disclosure agreements and licenses, and who
  			themselves mostly like to patent the innovations they make. They are deserved to be dishonoured and removed from the
  			scientific process itself. There is no philosophy in their science. In fact, their philosophy is descience. I may be technically
  			crossing my boundary here, without any formal proof. I do not intend to claim that all scientists in institution labs are
  			like under such regime, but as far ask i know, they are not much different from a capital owner or a subjugated factory worker,
  			& most of them do science, without ever knowing what science is about. They do have high degree of specific knowledge, which is
  			their primary curse. As they are ignorant about other systems, and with no thought process of <b>Systems Thinking</b>, they
  			fail to apply science for other problems and fields. This makes them non-explorative. This makes them un-managed work horses.
  			They become pure dopamine chasers.
  		</p>

  		<h3>DIY</h3>

  		<p>
  			Well from the above list of DIY contributions, one could easily learn some basic concepts and construction pattern of a typical
  			spectrometer, and does not much differ from our high school spectroscopy physics experiment that we would have played
  			with either a prism or a transmissive grating. Before going into how DIY can be done, one has to know what are all the
  			fundamental necessities for a spectrometer ?. The answer depends upon what spectrum we are interested upon. Although, many
  			factors for the construction design share similar ideas and principles. A spectrometer - typically the one represented for
  			IR, Visible, UV, spectral region, and that provides us with interesting data, for further analysis are specified with :

  			<ul>
  				<li>Resolving Power</li>
  				<li>Dynamic Range</li>
  				<li>Spectral Bandwidth</li>
  				<li>Spectral Resolution</li>
  				<li>Slit width</li>
  				<li>Spectral efficiency</li>
  				<li>Wavelength selection</li>
  				<li>Range of Photon count</li>
  				<li>Sensitivity</li>
  				<li>Accuracy</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Usually, a spectrometer of such type, will have a construction architecture that vary widely depending upon the spectral
  			region (wavelength) for which it is constructured. Many a times a straightforward approach for wavelength selection
  			or dispersion of energy would make the instrument larger and bulky. Innovative architectures that are used in optics,
  			are used heavily in constructing relatively small spectrometers, without compromising its efficiency. Those who designs
  			a spectrometer and constructs will see that the requirment for a analytical instrument and a communication device are not
  			much differed. For instance, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acousto-optic_modulator">AOTF</a> based crystal can
  			be used to construct both a high speed spectrometer as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength-division_multiplexing">WDM</a>
  			for optical communication.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			There are lot of individuals who do CD/DVD based spectrometer, by carefully stripping the "reflective" part from the substrate
  			and using it as the grating. However, we have to remember, that grating is one of the fascinating device, like any other optical
  			device, which is mostly handmade once, and nowadays are developed on a substrate with required pattern. Making a grating by
  			hand is going to be tough, without any prior experience and expertise in it. Further more, it either requires <b>grating
			maker</b> or a manufacturing facility. There is still lack of a good handheld/desktop grating maker even as an idea.
  			However, before trying such an attempt we must make sure other stuff are ready and in practice, to document the whole process
  			transparently and in scientific way that allows for peer reviews, as <a href="https://hackaday.io">Hackaday.io</a> does.
  			The awesome thing is, it severs as a common point for collaborative peer review, documenting, & practicing platform for
  			hackers philosophy.

  	  	  	<figcaption>Dispersion by a Prism</figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  		<p>
  			By understanding this, one would already get fascinated about how and why these prisms, and gratings disperse light in a such
  			a flamboyant way, why the hell do diffract ? what is special about them ? Atleast, i got so crazy about it when i first
  			properly understood about it myself. Understanding it, would surely makes one fall in love with the theory and with the
  			instrument itself. This fascination would surely push oneself to read about its history and learn even more about how they
  			come into existence, and some times go beyond their mathematics to understand why it is done so ?
  		</p>

  		<h3>Constituents</h3>
  		<p>
  			A spectrometer usually consists of the following modules that are essential for construction. The brain of a spectrometers is
  			usually a dispersing or diffracting element that exposes the band of wavelength which are measured by sensing manually or
  			using electronic instrumentation techniques. This brain nowadays are typically abstracted with innovative data acquisition,
  			wavelength selection, processing, analysis, report generation features, and in the near future these information technology
  			modules will soon be tied up with machine learning capabilities that will help the analysis to a wider level.
  		</p>

  	  	  	<figcaption>Modules of a typical Spectrometer</figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  		<h4>Required Architectures:</h4>
  		<p>
  			Any design will have few or more architectures, which makes the overall design innovative and really useful with good
  			reasoning balances. Designing any instrument is not a skewed one. It does requires architecture, and spectrometers do
  			have a highly interdisciplinary approach as far as reductionst science and technology is considered. On the whole, the
  			instrument mainly consists of :

  			<ul>
  				<li>Optical device Architecture</li>
  				<li>Electrical device Architecture</li>
  				<li>Computing Architecture</li>
  				<li>Information Architecture</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			The excitation source represents the source of our spectrum which we wish to play with. The sample/material under test,
  			is either shined before or after diffracting the composite source. If the placement of sample is configurable, then it would
  			be really awesome for the user. Furthermore, the type of sample, also matters of analysis. Arrangement of optical modules
  			are governed by optical architectures like <b>Czerny-Turner, Fastie-Ebert</b> design configurations. Conversion & count of sensed photons
  			of desired wavelength after diffraction & its interaction with the material through reflection or transmission, quntifying
  			the count, transferring the measured count to a safer location are governed by the electrical architecture that involves usage of
  			data convertors, microcontrollers, memory devices, communication interfaces.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Furthermore, the recorded data, have to be filtered, pre-processed, analyzed using mathematical models, formulaes,
  			analysing frakeworks, visualizing them and generating reports from them involves using architectures from computing and
  			information technology. Usually data acquisition, encapsulation frameworks, stacks & services; algorithms for efficient
  			analysis are deployed to <b>make sense of the data</b>.
  		</p>

  		<h3>Generic Process of Measurement</h3>
  		<p>
			What do we have now ?. We are literally equipped with good computing power, performing computing resources,
  			necessary data processing libraries, data & information analyzing frameworks and services, data sharing abilities &
  			networks, required licenses that ensure knowledge propagation while empowering the creators, contributors & users to
  			circumvent the monopoly and stealing effects. The essential stuff that are required to fill the gap are :

  			<ol>
  				<li>Optical design & Construction setup</li>
  				<li>Sensor, Actuator (transducer) interface</li>
  				<li>Computing, Controlling & Communication units</li>
  			</ol>

  			The process involved in using a spectrometer (or) spectrograph (or) spectrophotometer can be deconstructed into following simple steps:

					Having an energy source that fits the region of exploration or extends it, need to be excited

	  				material later. Nowadays, with the advent in power electronics, these spectral sources can be
	  				easily regulated, to control their photon output, heat loss, actively control heat dissipation,
	  				etc.. If the instrument consists of movable parts such as in monochromators, then they need to be
	  				aligned perfectly as far as possible, that needs active feedback to reset to their default positions

  				<p>
  					Wavelength selection is possible only because of the dispersive / diffraction / interference
  					element used, that actually deconstructs or splits up the composite electromagnetic energy (ex: white light)
  					into its sub constituent wavelengths (with specific energies). This can be analogously understood as
  					the living proof of a fourier transform, which states that any given complex signal can be written as
  					sum of fundamental and harmonic sines and cosines. Thus the wavelength dispersion can be simply
  					modeled as a transformation mechanism, that always does this.

  				<ul>
  					<li><h4>Dispersion Mechanism:</h4>
						<p>
							Dispersion is basically, very much similar to the kind of awesome rainbow phenomenon we see during
							drizzling in sky. Usually a <b>Prism</b> of specific material property, dimensions, geometry will
							be used, which can only be defined while making a Prism. Thus the dispersion mechanism, and its
							associated properties cannot be configured or controlled later. On the other hand, a variety of Prisms
							are manufactured to suit diverse set of requirements ranging from Telescopes, Binoculars, Periscopes,
							Spectroscopes, ... and several other optic instruments. Knowing how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion_(optics)">Dispersion</a>
							works in general, its relation with the refractive index, dielectrics, and velocity of electromagnetic
							wave inspires one to undetstand the relationships between natural phenomenons, which we incorrectly assume
							as not connected.
						</p>
  					</li>
  					<li><h4>Diffraction Mechanism:</h4>
  						<p>
  							Diffraction gratings of either transmission or reflection type are used typically to extract spectral
  							information. These gratings are once ruled by hand, and using mechanized systems, which are now replaced
  							with advanced manufacturing techniques offering higher grating density. However, once made they cannot be
  							modified later when the requirement arises, as in the case of Prisms. Thus several diffraction gratings
  							spanning & overlapping spectral bandwidths are manufactured, which can be later coupled for consecutive
  							spectral measurements. Each individual measurements are then stitched together properly to produce a
  							wider spectrum.
  						</p>
  					</li>
  					<li><h4>Interference Mechanism:</h4>
						<p>
							Interferometric mechanisms, offer another fascinating way to measure intensity of energy at several
							wavelengths, in an interesting way, without using any special materials. However, it equivalently
							has construction complexities, that asks for precision arrangement and calibration. The interference
							pattern is created by using several interference techniques, that involve clever optical arrangements
							ultimately creating a path difference which in turn producing an interferogram (interference pattern).
							Knowing about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry">Interferometry</a>, and how it is deeply
							related to most of the scientific exploration, proves its impact in optical engineering and allied
							instrumentation fields. In fact, with careful construction, interferometers could extract required
							information easily, while offering measurement advantages.

  					Nowadays, Optics have advanced with more fundamental research in material science, which have
  					facilitated with remarkable materials that are synthesized out of crystal materials that
  					exhibit unique optical, electrical, acoustical characteristics. Any of these materials when synthesized
  					with specific characteristics, are used instead of regular prism or grating, to facilitate active
  					control of wavelength selection - electronically. As the conventional prism and grating once constructed
  					could not be configured even within the required spectral bandwidth. Whereas, these special devices
  					which might be of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOTF">AOTF</a>,
  					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystal_tunable_filter">LCTF</a>,
  					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro-optic_modulator">EOM</a>, can provide flexibile control
  					and easier wavelength selection, without any requirement of rotation/moving parts in the instrument, that
  					effectively reduces the error due to wear, tear & vibration.
  				</p>

  				<p>
					After warming up the optical section, which is controlled by the electrical interface, now the
	  				electronic control and measurement unit, can either parallely count the photons they sense, or
	  				sequentially scan the spectrum by rotating or controlling the actuating element like motors which
	  				in turn rotates the dispersing or diffracting element. The transducer used for sensing the energy
	  				is of prime important, as they decide the measurement accuracy. The transducers has to match the
	  				spectral bandwidth of the dispersing element, i.e, our objective exploration space.

					Analog signal processing unit and Digital signal processing unit, could take care
	  				of filtering the noise from the electrical signal, from the transducer unit. Using proper
	  				data convertor, decides the numerical precision of photon count, which is a measure of
	  				particular wavelength intensity. Depending upon the type of optical interaction (transmisison
	  				or reflection), the spectral measurement will be changed to different record setting.

  				<p>
  					Measurement, involves with data acquisition, controlling back the diffraction if the active element
  					is electronically controllable through an actuator unit, like a steeper motor or piezoelectric
  					device, which in turn influences the minimum wavelength resolution to a certain extent. Uncertainty
  					in controlling the wavelength selection, decreases the accuracy of the instrument. Even before acquiring
  					the data, the SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) in the signal chain has to be improved. Signal integrity has
  					to be preserved. Measurement makes sense only when we know the accuracy in it.
  				</p>

  				<p>
  					While analyzing a spectrum which cannot be sensed by human eyes, they are usually measured, and then
  					transformed to the spectrum which we understand. Instead of such contradicting use, we can simply
  					record wavelength internsity per wavelength numerically. These numeric data, needs to be stored safely
  					for offline analysis and processing. Also based on the deployed applications, online measurement
  					coupled with powerful online processing are necessary in real-time situations.

  			<div id="accordion-spectral-analysis" class="accordion-section-content">
	  			<p>
					After recording the spectrum, of a test sample/material, it needs to be pre-processed
	  				to remove the artifacts added because of the instrument configuration, apply statistical
	  				filters, and prepare it for further spectral analysis where advanced transformations
	  				and statistical analysis would be deployed upon the data to reveal the information that
	  				makes sense and also to enable the revealed information to connect with other informations
	  				that provides the necessary feature or application.
	  			</p>

  				<p>
  					With Free & Open Source software rich analytical libraries can be built to suit the
  					spectroscopy requirements. Usually, a mathematical sub domain called as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemometrics">Chemometrics</a>
  					are mostly used to process the spectrum providing various statistical features, that help
  					the user to group, classify, register, identify a particular sample. Beautiful applications
  					of such mathematical and statistical treatment is that highly interdisciplinary subjuects can be
  					connected, which further reveals associated information, such as identifying the principal
  					molecules in the material and help determining the overal molecular structure in a probabilistic
  					manner.
  				</p>

  				<p>
  					Still only one type of spectrometer data cannot provide the complete detail of the material. It is
  					just one view, & interpretation from a particular angle. Thus, with more and more widespread use
  					of other spectroscopy like, NMR spectroscopy, Mass spectroscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, + other analytical
  					methods, provide multi modal information, which needs to be fused, abstrated to provide a multi-faceted
  					information, from which an <b>almost</b> view can be extracted. There are several gaps that are to be
  					filled in Chemometrics, Cheminformatics, Bioinformatics, Structure identification, Prediction, etc..

  		<h3>My Contribution & Criticism:</h3>
  		<p>
  			As you know now, that i have worked in a public funded research organization in India called CSIR (Council of Scientific &
  			Industrial Research) - for which i am partly satisfied and partly left scars in me because of its organizational
  			attitude that sounds more distance, remote and far cry from actual scientific temper - atleast that is what i have
  			experienced for the past 3.5 years. I mean, folks (scientists, engineers, research interns, project engineers, students)
  			over there are individually good, but as a group caught in making gadgets for industries nowadays. I do not want to question
  			the organizations intention to serve the medium, small scale or even bigger and massive industrial systems, but always
  			felt they are stuck with that alone, and <mark>never got time to think about common man and the necessity for making technologies
  			that not only address day to day necessities, but also in a open way</mark>. It has the potential to be instrumental in making
  			the technology democratic, scalable, far reaching.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			As much as i see, as a listener, i came to know the bitter truth about how folks over there are still in the 60-70's style
  			of <u>securing the innovation with <b>patents</b></u>. This creates friction between the peers altogether and stagnates the
  			overall progress and thus limited the proof of knowledge in action. I cannot prove and need not want to prove all the
  			internal cheaper politics myself here. That will be unwise for me to attempt. Every organization lingers with such negative
  			functions, but it might be satisfying to look at the brighter side, except for which i cannot find one rationally. All i
  			can see is the one massive scientific community -- which they calls themselves - became consuming grounds for massive
  			multi-national business, that make technology, tools & instruments that aids their research and development work - which
  			is itself is not a problem, but brings long term complications and deterioration in knowledge propagation through public
  			service. Nowadays, only a very few seems to understand about <b>science</b> & its relation with <b>socio-economic-political</b>
  			sphere. Only a few seems to accept the complexities involved. More still stick to the deterministic dogma.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Most of them nowadays use <b>free software, open hardware, open source</b> solutions, just as an alternative for high
  			cost technology. Only a few could digest the reality and community effort behind it. In this view, my common sense
  			interprets and visualizes them as only <mark>free loaders</mark>. The saddest part is most of them seems not to care about
  			scientific publication, its openness, community participation, philosophical discourse, licensing, distribution,
  			transparency, credit systems ... In such an environment, when student comes into the picture, they would most probably
  			oriented towards either pro-ignorance or pro-rebel attitude. These indicates the groups stubborness to not update thier real
  			knowledge in a scientific way. It seems, as though the whole movement stuck in a time frame.

  			I started in CSIR as a project engineer, who would be usually employed to support the research team in one of the
  			labs of the organization, which would get funding from the organizational finanical and administration cloud. As
  			a lover of free software, open hardware ethos, some how i have managed to inspire my lab senior and colleague.
  			I think i have made a small impact which they would least forget about my effort. I hope. We do love making instruments
  			and software associated with optics and non-destructive testing in general. I am ZERO about them, and still almost the
  			same. But with my interest ranging from embedded systems, to instrumentation, i pitched my actions which have certainly
  			lead me to learn about the instrumentation of spectroscopy and specifically towards <b>AOTF</b>, an awesome thing,
  			that enables regulatable/tunable Infra red spectral diffraction & wavelength selection. For the first time in my life,
  			i felt almost magical, as i came to realize, that simply <mark>we are controlling direction of light propagation, with
			sound</mark>. How cool it can get than this ???
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			After my service as project engineer, i again worked as <i>research intern</i>, during which my knowledge expanded
  			and erupted multi fold, learning about far reach areas of science and its interaction with other studies and fields.
  			Even though i felt little eccentric to my colleague and senior, i am ok with it, as i realized my mind is in a soupy
  			state for which it behaved mostly confused, dissonative, depressive, some times non-focus & hyper active, ... which
  			made me travel from a superlative thought process to feeling the reality about the systems i am living and part of.
  			This made me think about how my contribution would be useful atleast to my folks and friends, as far as i can reach.
  			Making instruments, and softwares are ok, but it is <b>underspecified</b> to solve a problem that i experience, and it
  			seems that i can see a way to solve it. But contradictorily i cannot solve it. This made me crazy. I mean you can see
  			the path, but cannot walk on it.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Before even walking the path, i realized that i had to cross through layers of thick walls, either by breaking it or by
  			bending its subjugation. Oh yes... i tried to publish my works in a series of six to sever papers. With no funding at
  			all, my team could not afford to publish the articles in a decent <u>open access</u> journal. I was literally waiting
  			for a escape route, but stayed because of my attachement with my senior mentor. This added fuel to my cognifive
  			dissonance pressure. However, with so much i learned, i realized the synthetic distances between what science is capable
  			of, what critical thinking humans are capable of, what socio-economiic-political stituations tamper such capabilities.
  			Realized why smart people running away (expatriating) to other nations. But it sounds silly and not a solution at all to
  			me. It does not felt like a solution made by a critical thinking person - more it sounded like a feudal thought to me.
  		</p>

  		<h3>Technically what have i done ?</h3>
  		<p>
  			I have first tried to interface the existing electronic control board with the AOTF & RF unit, and measure the sensed
  			wavelength intensity. This electronic board was first give to me with a proprietary license and with the availability of
  			only a proprietary software to program it <b>+</b> a proprietary sotware to construct a suprervisor system to control
  			the spectrophotometer instrument as a whole. I have managed to do it and with the help of previous student contributions
  			towards the project, i could easily finish it up earlier. During this period, i have <mark>learned fine soldering, bare metal
  			programming</mark> with <b>C</b> & assembly sometimes. Honestly, i gave me a intellectual satisfaction to see the machines
  			working as expected. Still, learned about free and open source softwares and stacks more from other student collaborator,
  			who helped me think interms of networks and webs.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			One fine day, we decided to equip the core spectrophotometer system with open hardware, an arduino - which is personally
  			affordable, (as our team had no funding properly from the cloud). We tested, and our projects are hosted in bitbucked and
  			github. My student collaborator have tried to share about versioning control systems, which i perfectly udnerstood as
  			systems theory, but sucked when it comes to practical usage. It took some time to get a hold of it by myself. With <a href="https://github.com/debanjum/Spectroserver">
			project source</a> <mark>published online,</mark> and licensed in <mark>GPL</mark> it felt like a good leap. We also fused
  			<mark>LaTex</mark> to the documentation and publication works, along with <mark>Gimp & Inkscape</mark> for illsutration purpose.
  			<mark>Scavis</mark> for scientific data visualization and analysis, <mark>Python, R for further statistical analysis</mark>,
  			Proprietary systems and the investments my team once made in them are literally in the dust bin now. Such actions, mustered
  			me <mark>courage & confidence</mark> to actively participate in communities and their discussions without any hesitation and
  			guilt.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			However, i still had to face the "security through obscurity" & other feudal, religious dogma from my other colleage who
  			loves to work in a <i>Microsoft</i> set of tools and technologies. I remember him to switch to use open sourced community
  			efforts like <b>OpenCV</b>, and the best thing is he used to criticize its open ness and learn by contributing and coding
  			strategy. In short, he could not handle all the knowledge that are transparent that are right before his eyes. He is
  			crying for a microsoft style abstraction even in data structures without ever even rationally trying to understand the
  			reasons behind the programming and stuff.

  		<h3>Are you interested in making a Grating ?</h3>
  		<p>
  			If you really like spectroscopy, and the core devices, and wondering about whether it is possible to atleast
  			ideate in first place, then please take a <a href="../../ideas/grating-maker/grating-maker.html">look at the post</a>, which
  			i have tried to express my ideation, while standing on the shoulders of the communities that existed before me and will
  			after me.
