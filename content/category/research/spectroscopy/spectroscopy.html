  	  	<p>Hello there <b>!</b></p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLIAMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	This is not a full fledged tutorial or history on spectroscopy and its awesomeness, rather i would
  	  		only like to share what i have learned, interpreted and understood in my experience and exploration.
  	  		The following contents might subject to change with my change in knowledge and further experience.

  		<h3>Why am i writing this ?</h3>
  		<p>
			I feel that even though spectroscopy along with the rise of optics, telescopy, radio, space exploration, material science,
  			food science, etc.... have penetrated deeper and wider into laboratories of massive institutions and instrument manufacturers,
  			it is been widely not democratized like any other awesome scientific instruments available. This article can be seen as a
  			template of a instrumentation engineer and lover, who screams about non-democratizing attitude of scientists, laboratory
  			engineers and instrument makers, and its associated knowledge sharing model, business model, etc... Apart from that, i would
  			generally explore and explain what i have learned and what are all the potential ideas that i have interpreted for the past
  			4+ years.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Even with so much little experience with spectroscopy and associated fields, i could come up with few awesome ideas,
  			that are pragmatic and at the same time felt the necessity for democratizing it, like few other people here and there
  			in the science and technology realm. One thing that still amuses me, is why cant former, <i>"wiser"</i>, better experienced
  			engineers, scientists, developers, interns, students, could democratize it ?

  			<ul>
  				<li>Is it a stigma among them <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it the public & perish thing <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it the patent systems <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it the economic & business models <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it they dont look at real problems <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it they work only for organization benefit <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it they just do their "job" <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it because they are isolated <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it because, mind bogged down by the complexity <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it, they have lost their <b>explorative</b> spirit <b>?</b></li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Personally, i like spectroscopy next to bicycling & bicycles. For me it is next awesome thing at equal to bicycles.
  			I love both of them and i read somebody quoting a similar thing in some book. However, i have always had it close
  			to my heart. It helped me to better understand about electromagnetics, wave propagation, mass - energy interaction,
  			and other awesome stuff that deal with energy & mass in physics. Even though when i am not good in math and programming,
  			this love have made me learn about many things which i am previously completely ignorant about. Somehow, it has
  			made me an anti-ignorant and made me more rational. I am fortunate, that i have worked with good mentor & colleagues
  			in a public laboratory. They have supported me morally, & economiclly, eventhough when we had debates and fights on
  			some stuff. On the whole, i learned a lot theoretically, but only less than that pragmatically.
  		</p>

  		<h3>What is Spectroscopy actually ?</h3>
  		<p>
  			It is all about understanding one of the fundamental energy form of nature - the <b>electromagnetic energy</b>. Specifically
  			the subject completely devotes to understand the interaction of energy with the mass, which together constitutes all
  			the elements of nature. Yes it deals a lot with quantum physics and electromagnetic wave theory, why materials behave in a
  			certain way when they interact with EM energy, what are the explainable reasons behind it etc. For a brief introduction
  			about spectroscopy, check out <a href="../../../../htmls/presentations.html">presentation</a> section on it. For me, it
  			started with <b>why food tasted, coloured and smelled so ?</b>, what is the scientific reason behind it ? why to explore it ?
  			how to explain it to my folks about it ? These questions have driven be partly crazy and partly rational.
  		</p>

  		<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/comics/spectroscopy/electromagnetic_spectrum.png" alt="em-spectrum">
  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>Electromagnetic Spectrum in XKCD's view</i></b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  		<p>
  			Simply any phenomenon which have a periodic pattern of change that can be represented as a wave can be measured in terms of
  			frequency and with collection of bunch of frequency we have a spectrum. The spectrum can be measured by a number of
  			means that varies depending upon the energy we are dealing with. The thing about electromagnetic spectrum however, is that
  			they are omnipresent. They present wherever matter is.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Soon, i have realized that spectroscopy is not just related with food, and my world view have significant changed from
  			entity & reduction oriented towards connection and holistic relations. May be because of my expansion of understanding and
  			interpretation critically changed. It had a rich history like any other field in science, and i have finally could
  			feel the non-reductionist approach in understanding science and started asking deeper questions myself. This while
  			keeping part of me deeply abstract, while at the same time, other part of me deeply tied with reality around me.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Ideas to solve problems that i felt, through spectroscopy started populating in my head. Without any proper means of
  			expressing it, they started clouding. I couldn't understand why the system mandates a Ph.D to innovate and discover
  			something scientific. I believe, that science is science no matter the academic degree one possess. I felt deprivation
  			of liberty and freedom in it. But my love of spectroscopy have never decreased and infact encouraged me to pursue
  			my own research independently, even if i am miserably going to fail.
  		</p>

  		<h3>Instruments</h3>

  		<p>
  			Instruments in association with spectroscopy are diversed, and vary widely in their design, construction, because of various
  			technological constraints. There is no signle instrument that could cover the whole electromagnetic spectrum. There cannot
  			exist a single ship with which we shall explore all of the ocean. These instruments were grouped based on the spectrum
  			they are capable to explore. Within each group, several types of instruments were innovated with varying architectures and
  			design. Thus a <b>Spectrometer</b> in general is an instrument that measures the spectrum - a part of electromagnetic
  			spectrum. It is also called as <b>Spectrophotometer</b> when the instrumentation is designed based on counting the photons
  			within the chosen spectrum. All of these instruments tend to derive quantities from the measured status of the spectrum
  			sensed from a particular material in terms of wavelength of the electromagnetic wave (could be visible light, IR, UV, X-ray,
  			Radio...).
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Many derived quantities & applications are possible, such as:

  			<ul>
  				<li>Distance</li>
  				<li>Density</li>
  				<li>Concentration</li>
  				<li>Vegetation</li>
  				<li>Temperature</li>
  				<li>Colour</li>
  				<li>Mass</li>
  				<li>Molecular Structure</li>
  				<li>Communication Channel</li>
  				<li>Aerial & Satellite imaging</li>
  				<li>...</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<h3>Democratization</h3>
  		<p>
  			Whether it is wave based or photon count based, these instruments are essential for a range of requirements such as
  			planetary exploration, mineral evaluation, material study, food inspection, ... spanning widest range of fields. Even
  			with its spread and penetration, democratization effect is very very less. Most of the instrument design are patented,
  			which have devasted the democratizing effect. Patent & Copyright systems, have made it sure that the design stay within
  			the manufacturer control, which further hanged the propagation of knowledge required to make such useful instruments
  			to the people. Whether it is possible to create an instrument or not by the commons, it is not a scientific process, to
  			block the propagation of knowledge just becuase something is not practically possible.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Right after 2009, with the evolution of Free Hardware, Open Data, Open Access evolution, following & adapting a similar
  			philosophy from the Free Software evolution, a few of the projects by some of the communities and individuals are
  			contributed for designing a spectrometer. While scientists and engineers who have worked for years in making such
  			instruments especially in space programs have not made their designs transparent, pointing their reasons to "confidential
  			matters" & "patents". Some of the recent projects which have a goal towards in making such instruments are :

  			<ul>
  				<li><a href="http://myspectral.com/">Spectruino</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry">Public Spectrometer</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/1279">Raman Pi, by fl@c@</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/12335">David H Haffner Sr's</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/10738-ottervis-lgl-spectrophotometer">Otter VIS by Esben Rossel</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/4141">Microspectrometer by Pure engineering</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/12724">Adam's</a></li>
  				<li><a href="http://opennirs.org/">Open NIRS</a></li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Still DIY community and hackers projects like the above are still a long way when compared to the commercially available
  			ones that have occupied scientific laboratories. One reason, is that these laboratories have stopped making their own
  			instruments - <b>kind of laziness</b> and started procuring proprietary instruments & devices - <b>imprisoned knowledge</b>.
  			DIY individuals & Community projects are still great way of making their instruments transparent, avaialble and accessible
  			to commons with suitable propagatable licenses. However, availability of necessary infrastructure of peer production,
  			are not available in many places around the world - primarily because of the lack of awareness about the idea of <b>peer
  			production</b> itself. With designs being shared and improved collaboratively using internet and collaborative platforms
  			built on it, it is very likely that the quality of these instruments will surely be improved & will surpass the performance
  			and quality of "commercial & proprietary" ones.
  		</p>

  		<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/comics/spectroscopy/purity.png" alt="purity-fight">
  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>Fight for Purity !</i></b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  		<p>
  			Democratization is not only effective in designs of such instruments, but also it protects the violation of data derived
  			from them. Previously, even with proprietary instruments they are mechanisms that are imposed by the manufacturers, who
  			control the data measured by instrument in the user's field. These manufacturers have started providing data and information
  			based service through internet - illustrating as a perfect reason to further reduce the scientists', engineers', spectroscopists'
  			work. Thus this shows the relation between monopolization of knowledge by patenting the design and imprisoning the information.
  			I believe with open systems in science and technology, soon the instruments will be widely available to commons.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Soon commons deserve to do science. It will be progressive in reality when science is done by commons than by paid and honoured
  			scientists who would work for money under a organizations fund, signed with non-disclosure agreements and licenses, and who
  			themselves mostly like to patent the innovations they make. They are deserved to be dishonoured and removed from the
  			scientific process itself. There is no philosophy in their science. In fact, their philosophy is descience. I may be technically
  			crossing my boundary here, without any formal proof. I do not intend to claim that all scientists in institution labs are
  			like under such regime, but as far ask i know, they are not much different from a capital owner or a subjugated factory worker,
  			& most of them do science, without ever knowing what science is about. They do have high degree of specific knowledge, which is
  			their primary curse. As they are ignorant about other systems, and with no thought process of <b>Systems Thinking</b>, they
  			fail to apply science for other problems and fields. This makes them non-explorative. This makes them un-managed work horses.
  			They become pure dopamine chasers.
  		</p>

  		<h3>DIY</h3>

  		<p>
  			Well from the above list of DIY contributions, one could easily learn some basic concepts and construction pattern of a typical
  			spectrometer, and does not much differ from our high school spectroscopy physics experiment that we would have played
  			with either a prism or a transmissive grating. Before going into how DIY can be done, one has to know what are all the
  			fundamental necessities for a spectrometer ?. The answer depends upon what spectrum we are interested upon. Although, many
  			factors for the construction design share similar ideas and principles. A spectrometer - typically the one represented for
  			IR, Visible, UV, spectral region, and that provides us with interesting data, for further analysis are specified with :

  			<ul>
  				<li>Resolving Power</li>
  				<li>Dynamic Range</li>
  				<li>Spectral Bandwidth</li>
  				<li>Spectral Resolution</li>
  				<li>Slit width</li>
  				<li>Spectral efficiency</li>
  				<li>Wavelength selection</li>
  				<li>Range of Photon count</li>
  				<li>Sensitivity</li>
  				<li>Accuracy</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Usually, a spectrometer of such type, will have a construction architecture that vary widely depending upon the spectral
  			region (wavelength) for which it is constructured. Many a times a straightforward approach for wavelength selection
  			or dispersion of energy would make the instrument larger and bulky. Innovative architectures that are used in optics,
  			are used heavily in constructing relatively small spectrometers, without compromising its efficiency. Those who designs
  			a spectrometer and constructs will see that the requirment for a analytical instrument and a communication device are not
  			much differed. For instance, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acousto-optic_modulator">AOTF</a> based crystal can
  			be used to construct both a high speed spectrometer as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength-division_multiplexing">WDM</a>
  			for optical communication.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			There are lot of individuals who do CD/DVD based spectrometer, by carefully stripping the "reflective" part from the substrate
  			and using it as the grating. However, we have to remember, that grating is one of the fascinating device, like any other optical
  			device, which is mostly handmade once, and nowadays are developed on a substrate with required pattern. Making a grating by
  			hand is going to be tough, without any prior experience and expertise in it. Further more, it either requires <b>grating
			maker</b> or a manufacturing facility. There is still lack of a good handheld/desktop grating maker even as an idea.
  			However, before trying such an attempt we must make sure other stuff are ready and in practice, to document the whole process
  			transparently and in scientific way that allows for peer reviews, as <a href="https://hackaday.io">Hackaday.io</a> does.
  			The awesome thing is, it severs as a common point for collaborative peer review, documenting, & practicing platform for
  			hackers philosophy.

  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>Dispersion by a Prism</i></b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  		<p>
  			By understanding this, one would already get fascinated about how and why these prisms, and gratings disperse light in a such
  			a flamboyant way, why the hell do diffract ? what is special about them ? Atleast, i got so crazy about it when i first
  			properly understood about it myself. Understanding it, would surely makes one fall in love with the theory and with the
  			instrument itself. This fascination would surely push oneself to read about its history and learn even more about how they
  			come into existence, and some times go beyond their mathematics to understand why it is done so ?
  		</p>

  		<h3>Constituents</h3>
  		<p>
  			A spectrometer usually consists of the following modules that are essential for construction. The brain of a spectrometers is
  			usually a dispersing or diffracting element that exposes the band of wavelength which are measured by sensing manually or
  			using electronic instrumentation techniques. This brain nowadays are typically abstracted with innovative data acquisition,
  			wavelength selection, processing, analysis, report generation features, and in the near future these information technology
  			modules will soon be tied up with machine learning capabilities that will help the analysis to a wider level.

  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>Modules of a typical Spectrometer</i></b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  		<h4>Required Architectures:</h4>
  		<p>
  			Any design will have few or more architectures, which makes the overall design innovative and really useful with good
  			reasoning balances. Designing any instrument is not a skewed one. It does requires architecture, and spectrometers do
  			have a highly interdisciplinary approach as far as reductionst science and technology is considered. On the whole, the
  			instrument mainly consists of :

  			<ul>
  				<li>Optical device Architecture</li>
  				<li>Electrical device Architecture</li>
  				<li>Computing Architecture</li>
  				<li>Information Architecture</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			The excitation source represents the source of our spectrum which we wish to play with. The sample/material under test,
  			is either shined before or after diffracting the composite source. If the placement of sample is configurable, then it would
  			be really awesome for the user. Furthermore, the type of sample, also matters of analysis. Arrangement of optical modules
  			are governed by optical architectures like <b>Czerny-Turner, Fastie-Ebert</b> design configurations. Conversion & count of sensed photons
  			of desired wavelength after diffraction & its interaction with the material through reflection or transmission, quntifying
  			the count, transferring the measured count to a safer location are governed by the electrical architecture that involves usage of
  			data convertors, microcontrollers, memory devices, communication interfaces.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Furthermore, the recorded data, have to be filtered, pre-processed, analyzed using mathematical models, formulaes,
  			analysing frakeworks, visualizing them and generating reports from them involves using architectures from computing and
  			information technology. Usually data acquisition, encapsulation frameworks, stacks & services; algorithms for efficient
  			analysis are deployed to <b>make sense of the data</b>.
  		</p>

  		<h3>Generic Process of Measurement</h3>
  		<p>
			What do we have now ?. We are literally equipped with good computing power, performing computing resources,
  			necessary data processing libraries, data & information analyzing frameworks and services, data sharing abilities &
  			networks, required licenses that ensure knowledge propagation while empowering the creators, contributors & users to
  			circumvent the monopoly and stealing effects. The essential stuff that are required to fill the gap are :

  			<ol>
  				<li>Optical design & Construction setup</li>
  				<li>Sensor, Actuator (transducer) interface</li>
  				<li>Computing, Controlling & Communication units</li>
  			</ol>

  			The process involved in using a spectrometer (or) spectrograph (or) spectrophotometer can be deconstructed into following simple steps:

					Having an energy source that fits the region of exploration or extends it, need to be excited

	  				easily regulated, to control their photon output, heat loss, actively control heat dissipation,
	  				etc.. If the instrument consists of movable parts such as in monochromators, then they need to be
	  				aligned perfectly as far as possible, that needs active feedback to reset to their default positions

	  				in turn rotates the dispersing or diffracting element. The transducer used for sensing the energy
	  				is of prime important, as they decide the measurement accuracy. The transducers has to match the
	  				spectral bandwidth of the dispersing element, i.e, our objective exploration space.

  				<p>
  					The wavelength selection is possible only because of the dispersive element or the diffraction
  					element used, that actually deconstructs or splits up the composite electromagnetic energy (ex: white light)
  					into its sub constituent wavelengths (with specific energies). This can be analogously understood as
  					the living proof of a fourier transform, which states that any given complex signal can be written as
  					sum of fundamental and harmonic sines and cosines. Thus the wavelength dispersion can be simply
  					modeled as a transformation mechanism, that always does this.

  				<p>
  					Nowadays, Optics have advanced with more fundamental research in material science, which have
  					facilitated with remarkable materials that are synthesized out of crystal materials that
  					exhibit unique optical, electrical, acoustical characteristics. Any of these materials when synthesized
  					with specific characteristics, are used instead of regular prism or grating, to facilitate active
  					control of wavelength selection - electronically. As the conventional prism and grating once constructed
  					could not be configured even within the required spectral bandwidth. Whereas, these special devices
  					which might be of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOTF">AOTF</a>,
  					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystal_tunable_filter">LCTF</a>,
  					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro-optic_modulator">EOM</a>, can provide flexibile control
  					and easier wavelength selection, without any requirement of rotation/moving parts in the instrument, that
  					effectively reduces the error due to wear, tear & vibration.

  					Measurement, involves with data acquisition, controlling back the diffraction if the active element
  					is electronically controllable through an actuator unit, like a steeper motor or piezoelectric
  					device, which in turn influences the minimum wavelength resolution to a certain extent. Uncertainty
  					in controlling the wavelength selection, decreases the accuracy of the instrument. Even before acquiring
  					the data, the SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) in the signal chain has to be improved. Signal integrity has
  					to be preserved. Measurement makes sense only when we know the accuracy in it.
  				</p>

  				<p>
  					While analyzing a spectrum which cannot be sensed by human eyes, they are usually measured, and then
  					transformed to the spectrum which we understand. Instead of such contradicting use, we can simply
  					record wavelength internsity per wavelength numerically. These numeric data, needs to be stored safely
  					for offline analysis and processing. Also based on the deployed applications, online measurement
  					coupled with powerful online processing are necessary in real-time situations.

					After recording the spectrum, of a test sample/material, it needs to be pre-processed
	  				to remove the artifacts added because of the instrument configuration, apply statistical
	  				filters, and prepare it for further spectral analysis where advanced transformations
	  				and statistical analysis would be deployed upon the data to reveal the information that
	  				makes sense and also to enable the revealed information to connect with other informations
	  				that provides the necessary feature or application.
	  			</p>

  				<p>
  					With Free & Open Source software rich analytical libraries can be built to suit the
  					spectroscopy requirements. Usually, a mathematical sub domain called as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemometrics">Chemometrics</a>
  					are mostly used to process the spectrum providing various statistical features, that help
  					the user to group, classify, register, identify a particular sample. Beautiful applications
  					of such mathematical and statistical treatment is that highly interdisciplinary subjuects can be
  					connected, which further reveals associated information, such as identifying the principal
  					molecules in the material and help determining the overal molecular structure in a probabilistic
  					manner.
  				</p>

  				<p>
  					Still only one type of spectrometer data cannot provide the complete detail of the material. It is
  					just one view, & interpretation from a particular angle. Thus, with more and more widespread use
  					of other spectroscopy like, NMR spectroscopy, Mass spectroscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, + other analytical
  					methods, provide multi modal information, which needs to be fused, abstrated to provide a multi-faceted
  					information, from which an <b>almost</b> view can be extracted. There are several gaps that are to be
  					filled in Chemometrics, Cheminformatics, Bioinformatics, Structure identification, Prediction, etc..

  		<h3>Look & Learn</h3>
  		<p>
  			As hackers, & independent researchers, developers, we cannot reject the proprietary solutions that are still working
  			and heavily deployed in the scientific circle. We have to look at them as a black box, which we have done for most of the
  			information technology, and erect alternative solutions & tools, which prove the actual science. Only when transparency
  			and propagation thrives, science sustains, otherwise it is a survivor who constantly fights for its liberty among the
  			monopolizers and proprietary occupiers, that churn out financial benefit from it, like leeches. However, we must not
  			forget the mechanism these leechers practice that make the dumb scientists and engineers to use it. With more and more
  			of them moving towards open technologies, they would react with new attempts to monopolize through other means.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Usually, technological complexity is solved with time, and the cost of democratizing and making it public decreases
  			with time, that increases the availability, and affordability. Instead of posing as a competition while head starting,
  			a best approach would be to fill the local needs and find alternative solutions where the leechers have not spread.
  			We need to learn, what kind of solutions they provide, how they provide, etc.. from them. It is not a bad thing to learn
  			from them. Only by being unbiased in evaluation, knowledge acceptance, we could be more critical and innovative. Current
  			Peer production, Peer 2 Peer sharing, Network effect, Collaborative developemnt, Cooperative building strategies needs
  			to be used effectively.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			I have done some market survey (although i am not very much a expert in it or even interested to do it..) from 2012 onward,
  			right after when i got the opportunity to work seriously in the field of spectroscopy that matched my interests and ideas,
  			to know whether any existing procducts are available or not. To my surprise, after the recent development in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Light_Processing">DLP</a>
  			and miniature opto-electronics, several proprietary companies in the food technology and process analytical technology
  			have been releasing spectrometers that are hand held, miniature, robust, portable, ... with all attractive features, and
  			some even offering the whole data analytics, and networking stack that targeted the research community.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			However, i find that the following few have been really into it <b>consumer spectroscopy</b>, each with its own marketing
  			strategies and advertisements.

  			<ul>
  				<li><a href="https://www.consumerphysics.com/myscio/">SCIO</a>- Consumer Physics | consumer gadgeting</li>
  				<li><a href="http://tellspec.com/">Tellspec</a> | Consumer gadgeting</li>
  				<li>... other industrial heavy weight champions that supply for scientific community</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			For me, personally both are not worthy in spreading the science and technology in a sustainable way. When it comes to food,
  			everybody eats it, and anybody can be persuaded to be health conscious and thus in turn could generate a <b>social capital
			that craves for such technology, in todays health conscious population, that lives a terribly bad life style, within a
  			terrible environment conditions consuming terrible factory foods, under a treadmilled - perpetuated - vicious cycle.</b>
  			Both provides suitable example, how not to make a commons product. However, there is always something to learn from such
  			products too.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			While both having a similar business models, i personally believe, that tellspec inc. have  been bumpy during its initial
  			years and i still cannot incline it to it, for its data centralization and <b>patented mathematics</b> approach - that
  			kind of kills the very notion of science and spectroscopy itself. SCIO, is like any other silicon - valley company,
  			seriously considers quality, but completely accepting its proprietary nature, and have always stayed relatively stable
  			in its specifications and show cases. I am not a product designer or a market evaluator to compare both.
  		</p>

  		<h4>What are we currently lacking ?</h4>
  		<p>
  			There are several works which need to be done to find alternatives in open technology realm, pertaining to the
  			spectroscopy field. Some of them are:

  			<ul>
  				<li>Appropriate design & development thought process</li>
  				<li>FOSS based OS for Spectrometer instruments</li>
  				<li>CBPP designs for optical devices</li>
  				<li>Open Data format, and collective data contribution as spectras</li>
  				<li>Quality grading the collaboratively collected data</li>
  				<li>Scientific Data sharing means and Network</li>
  				<li>Data analysis, Mining, Machine learning stacks</li>
  				<li>Spectra to Molecules to Structure to Material Identification - mechanisms</li>
  				<li>Aiding molecular modeling with high quality spectral information</li>
  				<li>Innovating areas of application for commons of use value</li>
  				<li>Survey of necessities where spectroscopy science & tech. can be useful</li>
  				<li>Democratizing through <b>Amateur Spectroscopy</b></li>
  				<li>Open data licensing the spectra, and using it for developing & evaluating mining, & machine learning algorithms, tools</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<h3>How about a Grating Maker ?</h3>
  		<p>
			With the current technological scenario, affordability plays a significant role in collecting the necessary
  			modules with which the instrument can be constructed based on a reference design. Even though a high end design is
  			avaialble openly, with proper licenses and stuff, who is affordable to make such a <b>costlier</b> design ?
  			Affordability is relative. On the other hand, when the design is economic, and could made affordable to most of the people,
  			using widely available components, then the design sure will be immediately put into <b>use-value</b>. In the case of
  			designing and constructing a spectrometer, with todays high end devices like AOTF/LCTC.. needs complex design, and
  			procuring the devices from a very fewly avaiable manufacturer, which increases the cost and allows for monopoly effect.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			If there is a design idea, atleast in just a conceptual way, that encourages one to think about hacking the existing
  			devices, leveraging existing mass manufacturing supply chain, and doing it, will surely mark a milestone for such projects.
  			While ruling out the high end optical devices, we turn over to spectrometers with either prism, grating or interferometer
  			techniques to get the wavelength response over a defined spectral bandwidth - coupled with necessary other optical devices.
  			We also do know that CD/DVD's used nowadays as mass secondary storage devices are kind of reduced after wide spread use of
  			USB memory sticks. Nevertheless, hackers use DVD's transparent layer to construct their own transmission grating. These
  			construction are cool, but will never compete with the existing gratings performance. Contradictarily, these DVD's with the
  			same floor area, are available with different storage densities, all due to decreased track width necessary enough to read
  			back the data. This means, that it is competing with the grating density offered by the grating manufacturers.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			In the case of new CD/DVD's their topography at the micro/nano scale seems to be of regular pattern. This new CD/DVD's
  			transparent plate can then serve as good grating.
  		</p>

  			<figcaption><b><i>Microscopic topographic grooves in blank CD, DVD</i> ( attributed to nnin.org )</b></figcaption>
		</figure>

  		<p>
  			Only difference here is the grooves in the used CD/DVD's are not of regular pattern and are formed based on the data and meta
  			data while burning(recording). <b>What if</b> one can able to change the data encoding electronics to enable record the
  			data such that the grating is formed with regular pattern ? (instead of creating pits and pots). Now the data - a.k.a.
  			pattern which we inscribe is the grating pattern we need. If this is achieved, then using the conventional hacking method,
  			we can make a much better grating or else go one step further, and innovate a complete <b>Grating maker</b> that makes
  			grating on square/rectangular substrate. This requires hardware development from scratch. I believe, making a grating with
  			laser would be much better than making a grating with traditional diamond tip.
  		</p>

  			<figcaption><b><i>Blank CD/DVD's can be mostly used as Transmission grating</i></b></figcaption>
		</figure>

  		<h4>Let's say it is available ! SO WHAT ?</h4>
  		<p>
  			What will happen if such a tool is available along with a 3D printer, atleast in a hacker space ? Well, we shall start
  			making gratings. We will churn out making them according to the spectral bandwidth we wish to explore. With CBPP designs
  			and open hardware electronics in hand, we will couple it with handheld style spectrometers, which will finally empower
  			the commons with a spectrometer, that atleast will enable them to capture the spectral data of a material which they
  			point to. At first, this will enable to commonly collect the data, treat it, learn from it, analyze it, and make sense of it.
  			With additional FOSS computing libraries & stacks, machine learning, could be applied. Now, with connectivity in hand,
  			and <b>Open spectrometer</b> in hand, commons finally have a democratized solution which enable them to inspect food,
  			or any other material, atleast before they purchase or share - instead of depending upon layers of food inspectors and
  			super food inspectors..
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			One might rehack, and attach such an instrument with their telescope, microscope, or with their kitchen appliances like mixers,
  			to study about the chemistry and bio-chemistry happening actively in the food they like to eat. It lets them acquire the
  			nutritional information for the food they make, and let themselves quantify their diet practice instead of blindly
  			depending upon a dumb tabulation of diet, which we do not know why are we advised to eat at first place. Furthermore, all the
  			cheap and non-nutrional, addictive beverages, cold biting drinks, can be checked for their constitutents publicly, which
  			they cannot hide anymore with democratized proof, so that finally <b>commons can able to say NO</b> to their harmful
  			factory foods.
  		</p>

  			<figcaption><b><i>Conceptual device that can turn used CD/DVD into reusable transmission grating</i></b></figcaption>
		</figure>

  		<p>
  			Evenmore, terrace gardeners, home gardeners, farmers, can evaluate their produce which can be evaluated by people
  			whenever they wish. This adds to eradication of <b>disguised organic/natural produce</b> to be rejected by commons.
  			Farmers and gardeners can even test their soil health and fertility by analysing it with such open spectrometers.
  			Certainly these instruments will also help one to evaluate the seed quality. Literally there are thousands and thousands of
  			papers avaialble that prove the effective use of spectrometers for a wider range of uses than i have said here.
