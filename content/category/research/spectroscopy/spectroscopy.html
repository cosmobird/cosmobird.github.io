  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLIAMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	This is not a full fledged tutorial or history on spectroscopy and its awesomeness, rather i would
  	  		only like to share what i have learned, interpreted and understood in my experience and exploration.
  	  		The following contents might subject to change with my change in knowledge and further experience.

  		<h3>Why this article ?</h3>
  		<p>
			I feel that even though spectroscopy along with the rise of optics, telescopy, radio, space exploration, material science,
  			food science, etc.... have penetrated deeper and wider into laboratories of massive institutions and instrument manufacturers,
  			it is been widely not democratized like any other awesome scientific instruments available. This article can be seen as a
  			template of a instrumentation engineer and lover, who screams about non-democratizing attitude of scientists, laboratory
  			engineers and instrument makers, and its associated knowledge sharing model, business model, etc... Apart from that, i would
  			generally explore and explain what i have learned and what are all the potential ideas that i have interpreted for the past
  			4+ years.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Even with so much little experience with spectroscopy and associated fields, i could come up with few awesome ideas,
  			that are pragmatic and at the same time felt the necessity for democratizing it, like few other people here and there
  			in the science and technology realm. One thing that still amuses me, is why cant former, <i>"wiser"</i>, better experienced
  			engineers, scientists, developers, interns, students, could democratize it ?

  			<ul>
  				<li>Is it a stigma among them <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it the public & perish thing that eroded most of the innovation <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it the patent systems that always damned knowledge propagation <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it the economic & business models that only orient for monopoly <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it they dont have time to look at the real problems at all <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it they work for an organizatin & not for people <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it they just do their "job" - without passion <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it because they are isolated from social resposibility by the organization <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it because, mentally their minds are bogged down by the complexity <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it, that they have lost their <b>explorative</b> spirit <b>?</b></li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Personally, i like spectroscopy next to bicycling & bicycles. For me it is next awesomething at equal to bicycles.
  			It love both of them and i read somebody quoting a similar thing in some book. However, i have always had it close
  			to my heart. It helped me to better understand about electromagnetics, wave propagation, mass - energy interaction,
  			and other awesome stuff that deal with spectrum in physics. Even though when i am not good in math and programming,
  			this love have made me learn about many things which i am previously completely ignorant about. Somehow, it has
  			made me an anti-ignorant and made me more rational. I am fortunate, that i have worked with good mentor & colleagues
  			in a public laboratory. They have supported me morally, & economiclly, eventhough when we had debates and fights on
  			some stuff. On the whole, i learned a lot theoretically, but only less than that pragmatically.
