  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLIAMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	This is not a full fledged tutorial or history on spectroscopy and its awesomeness, rather i would
  	  		only like to share what i have learned, interpreted and understood in my experience and exploration.
  	  		The following contents might subject to change with my change in knowledge and further experience.

  		<h3>Why am i writing this ?</h3>
  		<p>
			I feel that even though spectroscopy along with the rise of optics, telescopy, radio, space exploration, material science,
  			food science, etc.... have penetrated deeper and wider into laboratories of massive institutions and instrument manufacturers,
  			it is been widely not democratized like any other awesome scientific instruments available. This article can be seen as a
  			template of a instrumentation engineer and lover, who screams about non-democratizing attitude of scientists, laboratory
  			engineers and instrument makers, and its associated knowledge sharing model, business model, etc... Apart from that, i would
  			generally explore and explain what i have learned and what are all the potential ideas that i have interpreted for the past
  			4+ years.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Even with so much little experience with spectroscopy and associated fields, i could come up with few awesome ideas,
  			that are pragmatic and at the same time felt the necessity for democratizing it, like few other people here and there
  			in the science and technology realm. One thing that still amuses me, is why cant former, <i>"wiser"</i>, better experienced
  			engineers, scientists, developers, interns, students, could democratize it ?

  			<ul>
  				<li>Is it a stigma among them <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it the public & perish thing that eroded most of the innovation <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it the patent systems that always damned knowledge propagation <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it the economic & business models that only orient for monopoly <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it they dont have time to look at the real problems at all <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it they work for an organization & not for people <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it they just do their "job" - without passion <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it because they are isolated from social resposibility by the organization <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it because, mentally their minds are bogged down by the complexity <b>?</b></li>
  				<li>Is it, that they have lost their <b>explorative</b> spirit <b>?</b></li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Personally, i like spectroscopy next to bicycling & bicycles. For me it is next awesome thing at equal to bicycles.
  			I love both of them and i read somebody quoting a similar thing in some book. However, i have always had it close
  			to my heart. It helped me to better understand about electromagnetics, wave propagation, mass - energy interaction,
  			and other awesome stuff that deal with energy & mass in physics. Even though when i am not good in math and programming,
  			this love have made me learn about many things which i am previously completely ignorant about. Somehow, it has
  			made me an anti-ignorant and made me more rational. I am fortunate, that i have worked with good mentor & colleagues
  			in a public laboratory. They have supported me morally, & economiclly, eventhough when we had debates and fights on
  			some stuff. On the whole, i learned a lot theoretically, but only less than that pragmatically.
  		</p>

  		<h3>What is Spectroscopy actually ?</h3>
  		<p>
  			It is all about understanding one of the fundamental energy form of nature - the <b>electromagnetic energy</b>. Specifically
  			the subject completely devotes to understand the interaction of energy with the mass, which together constitutes all
  			the elements of nature. Yes it deals a lot with quantum physics and electromagnetic wave theory, why materials behave in a
  			certain way when they interact with EM energy, what are the explainable reasons behind it etc. For a brief introduction
  			about spectroscopy, check out <a href="../../../../htmls/presentations.html">presentation</a> section on it. For me, it
  			started with <b>why food tasted, coloured and smelled so ?</b>, what is the scientific reason behind it ? why to explore it ?
  			how to explain it to my folks about it ? These questions have driven be partly crazy and partly rational.
  		</p>

  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>Electromagnetic Spectrum in XKCD's view</i></b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  		<p>
  			Simply any phenomenon which have a periodic pattern of change that can be represented as a wave can be measured in terms of
  			frequency and with collection of bunch of frequency we have a spectrum. The spectrum can be measured by a number of
  			means that varies depending upon the energy we are dealing with. The thing about electromagnetic spectrum however, is that
  			they are omnipresent. They present wherever matter is.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Soon, i have realized that spectroscopy is not just related with food, and my world view have significant changed from
  			entity & reduction oriented towards connection and holistic relations. May be because of my expansion of understanding and
  			interpretation critically changed. It had a rich history like any other field in science, and i have finally could
  			feel the non-reductionist approach in understanding science and started asking deeper questions myself. This while
  			keeping part of me deeply abstract, while at the same time, other part of me deeply tied with reality around me.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Ideas to solve problems that i felt, through spectroscopy started populating in my head. Without any proper means of
  			expressing it, they started clouding. I couldn't understand why the system mandates a Ph.D to innovate and discover
  			something scientific. I believe, that science is science no matter the academic degree one possess. I felt deprivation
  			of liberty and freedom in it. But my love of spectroscopy have never decreased and infact encouraged me to pursue
  			my own research independently, even if i am miserably going to fail.
  		</p>

  		<h3>Instruments</h3>

  		<p>
  			Instruments in association with spectroscopy are diversed, and vary widely in their design, construction, because of various
  			technological constraints. There is no signle instrument that could cover the whole electromagnetic spectrum. There cannot
  			exist a single ship with which we shall explore all of the ocean. These instruments were grouped based on the spectrum
  			they are capable to explore. Within each group, several types of instruments were innovated with varying architectures and
  			design. Thus a <b>Spectrometer</b> in general is an instrument that measures the spectrum - a part of electromagnetic
  			spectrum. It is also called as <b>Spectrophotometer</b> when the instrumentation is designed based on counting the photons
  			within the chosen spectrum. All of these instruments tend to derive quantities from the measured status of the spectrum
  			sensed from a particular material in terms of wavelength of the electromagnetic wave (could be visible light, IR, UV, X-ray,
  			Radio...).
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Many derived quantities & applications are possible, such as:

  			<ul>
  				<li>Distance</li>
  				<li>Density</li>
  				<li>Concentration</li>
  				<li>Vegetation</li>
  				<li>Temperature</li>
  				<li>Colour</li>
  				<li>Mass</li>
  				<li>Molecular Structure</li>
  				<li>Communication Channel</li>
  				<li>Aerial & Satellite imaging</li>
  				<li>...</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<h3>Democratization</h3>
  		<p>
  			Whether it is wave based or photon count based, these instruments are essential for a range of requirements such as
  			planetary exploration, mineral evaluation, material study, food inspection, ... spanning widest range of fields. Even
  			with its spread and penetration, democratization effect is very very less. Most of the instrument design are patented,
  			which have devasted the democratizing effect. Patent & Copyright systems, have made it sure that the design stay within
  			the manufacturer control, which further hanged the propagation of knowledge required to make such useful instruments
  			to the people. Whether it is possible to create an instrument or not by the commons, it is not a scientific process, to
  			block the propagation of knowledge just becuase something is not practically possible.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Right after 2009, with the evolution of Free Hardware, Open Data, Open Access evolution, following & adapting a similar
  			philosophy from the Free Software evolution, a few of the projects by some of the communities and individuals are
  			contributed for designing a spectrometer. While scientists and engineers who have worked for years in making such
  			instruments especially in space programs have not made their designs transparent, pointing their reasons to "confidential
  			matters" & "patents". Some of the recent projects which have a goal towards in making such instruments are :

  			<ul>
  				<li><a href="http://myspectral.com/">Spectruino</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://publiclab.org/wiki/spectrometry">Public Spectrometer</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/1279">Raman Pi, by fl@c@</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/12335">David H Haffner Sr's</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/10738-ottervis-lgl-spectrophotometer">Otter VIS by Esben Rossel</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/4141">Microspectrometer by Pure engineering</a></li>
  				<li><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/12724">Adam's</a></li>
  				<li><a href="http://opennirs.org/">Open NIRS</a></li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Still DIY community and hackers projects like the above are still a long way when compared to the commercially available
  			ones that have occupied scientific laboratories. One reason, is that these laboratories have stopped making their own
  			instruments - <b>kind of laziness</b> and started procuring proprietary instruments & devices - <b>imprisoned knowledge</b>.
  			DIY individuals & Community projects are still great way of making their instruments transparent, avaialble and accessible
  			to commons with suitable propagatable licenses. However, availability of necessary infrastructure of peer production,
  			are not available in many places around the world - primarily because of the lack of awareness about the idea of <b>peer
  			production</b> itself. With designs being shared and improved collaboratively using internet and collaborative platforms
  			built on it, it is very likely that the quality of these instruments will surely be improved & will surpass the performance
  			and quality of "commercial & proprietary" ones.
  		</p>

  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/comics/spectroscopy/purity.png" alt="purity-fight">
  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>Fight for Purity !</i></b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  		<p>
  			Democratization is not only effective in designs of such instruments, but also it protects the violation of data derived
  			from them. Previously, even with proprietary instruments they are mechanisms that are imposed by the manufacturers, who
  			control the data measured by instrument in the user's field. These manufacturers have started providing data and information
  			based service through internet - illustrating as a perfect reason to further reduce the scientists', engineers', spectroscopists'
  			work. Thus this shows the relation between monopolization of knowledge by patenting the design and imprisoning the information.
  			I believe with open systems in science and technology, soon the instruments will be widely available to commons.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Soon commons deserve to do science. It will be progressive in reality when science is done by commons than by paid and honoured
  			scientists who would work for money under a organizations fund, signed with non-disclosure agreements and licenses, and who
  			themselves mostly like to patent the innovations they make. They are deserved to be dishonoured and removed from the
  			scientific process itself. There is no philosophy in their science. In fact, their philosophy is descience. I may be technically
  			crossing my boundary here, without any formal proof. I do not intend to claim that all scientists in institution labs are
  			like under such regime, but as far ask i know, they are not much different from a capital owner or a subjugated factory worker,
  			& most of them do science, without ever knowing what science is about. They do have high degree of specific knowledge, which is
  			their primary curse. As they are ignorant about other systems, and with no thought process of <b>Systems Thinking</b>, they
  			fail to apply science for other problems and fields. This makes them non-explorative. This makes them un-managed work horses.
  			They become pure dopamine chasers.
  		</p>

  		<h3>DIY</h3>

  		<p>
  			Well from the above list of DIY contributions, one could easily learn some basic concepts and construction pattern of a typical
  			spectrometer, and does not much differ from our high school spectroscopy physics experiment that we would have played
  			with either a prism or a transmissive grating. Before going into how DIY can be done, one has to know what are all the
  			fundamental necessities for a spectrometer ?. The answer depends upon what spectrum we are interested upon. Although, many
  			factors for the construction design share similar ideas and principles. A spectrometer - typically the one represented for
  			IR, Visible, UV, spectral region, and that provides us with interesting data, for further analysis are specified with :

  			<ul>
  				<li>Resolving Power</li>
  				<li>Spectral Bandwidth</li>
  				<li>Spectral Resolution</li>
  				<li>Slit width</li>
  				<li>Spectral efficiency</li>
  				<li>Wavelength selection</li>
  				<li>Range of Photon count</li>
  				<li>Sensitivity</li>
  				<li>Accuracy</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Usually, a spectrometer of such type, will have a construction architecture that vary widely depending upon the spectral
  			region (wavelength) for which it is constructured. Many a times a straightforward approach for wavelength selection
  			or dispersion of energy would make the instrument larger and bulky. Innovative architectures that are used in optics,
  			are used heavily in constructing relatively small spectrometers, without compromising its efficiency. Those who designs
  			a spectrometer and constructs will see that the requirment for a analytical instrument and a communication device are not
  			much differed. For instance, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acousto-optic_modulator">AOTF</a> based crystal can
  			be used to construct both a high speed spectrometer as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelength-division_multiplexing">WDM</a>
  			for optical communication.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			There are lot of individuals who do CD/DVD based spectrometer, by carefully stripping the "reflective" part from the substrate
  			and using it as the grating. However, we have to remember, that grating is one of the fascinating device, like any other optical
  			device, which is mostly handmade once, and nowadays are developed on a substrate with required pattern. Making a grating by
  			hand is going to be tough, without any prior experience and expertise in it. Further more, it either requires <b>grating
			maker</b> or a manufacturing facility. There is still lack of a good handheld/desktop grating maker even as an idea.
  			However, before trying such an attempt we must make sure other stuff are ready and in practice, to document the whole process
  			transparently and in scientific way that allows for peer reviews, as <a href="https://hackaday.io">Hackaday.io</a> does.
  			The awesome thing is, it severs as a common point for collaborative peer review, documenting, & practicing platform for
  			hackers philosophy.

  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>Dispersion by a Prism</i></b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  		<p>
  			By understanding this, one would already get fascinated about how and why these prisms, and gratings disperse light in a such
  			a flamboyant way, why the hell do diffract ? what is special about them ? Atleast, i got so crazy about it when i first
  			properly understood about it myself. Understanding it, would surely makes one fall in love with the theory and with the
  			instrument itself. This fascination would surely push oneself to read about its history and learn even more about how they
  			come into existence, and some times go beyond their mathematics to understand why it is done so ?
  		</p>

  		<h3>Constituents</h3>
  		<p>
  			A spectrometer usually consists of the following modules that are essential for construction. The brain of a spectrometers is
  			usually a dispersing or diffracting element that exposes the band of wavelength which are measured by sensing manually or
  			using electronic instrumentation techniques. This brain nowadays are typically abstracted with innovative data acquisition,
  			wavelength selection, processing, analysis, report generation features, and in the near future these information technology
  			modules will soon be tied up with machine learning capabilities that will help the analysis to a wider level.
