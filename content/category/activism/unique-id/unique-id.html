  	  	<p>Hey there establishment supporters <b>!</b></p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLAIMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The following are <b>my views</b> about the Unique Id. system implemented in India, which is now branded
  	  		as Aadhaar. I still believe, that having and sharing my views and thoughts, is still possible, with liberties
  	  		gauranteed by Indian Constitution, to its law abiding Citizens, which is fundamentally founted from the
  	  		values of freedom, democracy, liberty, equality, secular nature, civil disobedience... Yes, i am legally an
  	  		Indian citizen. But there is no reason to submit my proof of citizenship to anybody who desperately needs it.
  	  		It is my liberty and consent to decide whether to provide it or not. If any establishemnt or government felt
  	  		repulsed by this, executing some dumb actions based on despair, then it would be a best proof, that they
  	  		are the perfect examples of dissent supression, & conservational attitude.
  	  	</p>

		<h3>WHY ? WHY ? WHY ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
			Why am i writing this, when i have other interesting to do ? Basically, i dont like complaining about stuff,
  	  		crying around a problem, without atleast moving a stick or even trying that ! But literally we are in a situation
  	  		where critical thinking and open progressive discussion becoming few and rare. These days common people discussing
  	  		about social, economic, political environment, systems itself is considered as a rebellious attitude by the
  	  		governments and establishments. In India especially, every peaceful protest demonstrated by common people have been
  	  		systematically oppressed, subjugated, hindered since independence & republic. As a result of continuous and cumulative
  	  		thoughts in my mind - sometimes, -- no most of the times -- i ask myself :
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p class="content-blockquote">
  	  		<b>  am i part of this republic nation that ensured liberty in its constitution ?
  	  		     <br>
  	  		     am i really living in a democratic republic country ?
  	  		     <br>
  	  		     does others feel the same way i do ? "
  	  		</b>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h4>Am I Conspiring ?</h4>
  	  	<p>
  	  		Commonnnnn folks ! really ? there is <b><i><u>NO</u></i> illegal purpose</b> i am trying to achieve here, or i do not
  	  		wish to communicate with conspirators out there on this issue ! For so long, i felt that this identification thing
  	  		is taken very lightly by the common people, for their lack of awareness on the principles of liberty, constitution,
  	  		technocracy, subject matter on - technology driven human identification. It will be very much safe to say, that
  	  		governments in India - both at the Centre and the State, doesn't have time to deal the real problems faced by the
  	  		people. It is very much focuses on infusing <b>pragmatism</b> to overhaul its machinery, to defend its structure
  	  		through offensive tactics. We the people, majority, are very much happy in enrolling ourselves to such programmes &
  	  		projects, without even raising a simple question.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  		For the majority of us, are well trained with thoughts such as:

  	  		<ul>
  	  			<li>Fear of Government & Authority</li>
  	  			<li>Never question a Order from higher in the chain</li>
  	  			<li>Belief & Trust in Government</li>
  	  			<li>Belief in Party manifestos</li>
  	  			<li>Lack of Courage & Critical thinking</li>
  	  			<li>Consuming products with monthly wages</li>
  	  			<li>Having happy weekends, after tiresome work</li>
  	  			<li>Work for 40+ hours a week to earn</li>
  	  			<li>Only a loser would go on criticize government acts</li>
  	  			<li>Nationalism</li>
  	  			<li>Believe, ( Literacy == Education )</li>
  	  			<li>Educate to get a day job</li>
  	  			<li>Slavery is a past thing ! We're just being producting in our free time !</li>
  	  			<li>Those who criticize the government are extremists / terrorists</li>
  	  			<li>Only a wrong doer, will have a secret</li>
  	  			<li>...</li>
  	  		</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  		Then the majority & government from its support derived from dumb majority, instigate pressure on the few critically
  	  		thinking people, socially & economically. Nowadays, governments empowers its <b>law enforcement units with weapons & acts</b>
  	  		that helps them instigate protestors immorally & unlawfully, to stir chaos so that authority can use the chaotic situation to
  	  		oppress the peaceful protests in the name of <b>pre-emptive defense against <i><u>peace</u></i> protests</b>. Without people being dumb,
  	  		this would not be possible. This clear indicates, that the ratio of being people dumb seems to be increased or atleast not
  	  		changed since independence, for we are busy in consuming products that take photos.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  		If you think i am still trying to conspire... sorry dude... i cannot pull u from your bubble ! Live in it - consume it -
  	  		breathe it - excrete in it - die in it - rot in it ! <b>peacefully</b>.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  		I like to analyze stuff, as wide and deep as i can, you know !, stuff like deconstrucing a systems architecture, with the
  	  		transparency it offers, and learn from it. With peer discussion, introspection & retrospection, i would see what i would
  	  		tinker with it, where it can be tweaked atleast conceptually, to see whether it can better solve the problem it is trying
  	  		to address or not. Similarly, i would try to go to its <b>reasoning roots</b> to know why ? the system is constructed in
  	  		first place, and bring the reasons in bright light, to question it as though i am in a boxing ring with it.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>What are we lacking & bogged with ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
			Generally we people lack in socio-economic-political stuff. We by default assume, that it is the <b>jobs</b> of
  	  		government authorities, economists, politicians to deal with such problems, and that's why we <b>voted</b> for them, or
  	  		atleast that is the reason, we trusted on what we are selling our votes for. Personally i think we lack on the following
  	  		basic subjects :

  	  		<ul>
  	  			<li>Liberty, Empathy, Equality</li>
  	  			<li>Democracy, Republic, Independence</li>
  	  			<li>Constitution - Basic Rights, Duties</li>
  	  			<li>Local Geography & Economics</li>
  	  			<li>Economics that does not focus on Purchasing Power</li>
  	  		</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  		On the other hand, it seems that we are bogged down by the following thoughts/stuff :

  	  		<ul>
  	  			<li>Specific Skill & Financial apprisals as fruits</li>
  	  			<li>Purchasing power to enjoy Consumerism</li>
  	  			<li>Fear of Authority & Government</li>
  	  			<li>Religions, instilled taboos</li>
  	  			<li>Cate & Language segregations</li>
  	  			<li>There are people, losers who take care of criticisms</li>
  	  			<li>Subjugative & Unjust laws</li>
  	  		</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>LET'S GET TO THE SUBJECT :)</h3>
