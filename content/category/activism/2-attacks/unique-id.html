  	  	<p>Hey there establishment supporters <b>!</b></p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLAIMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The following are <b>my views</b> about the Unique Id. system implemented in India, which is now branded
  	  		as Aadhaar. I still believe, that having and sharing my views and thoughts, is still possible, with liberties
  	  		gauranteed by Indian Constitution, to its law abiding Citizens, which is fundamentally founted from the
  	  		values of freedom, democracy, liberty, equality, secular nature, civil disobedience... Yes, i am legally an
  	  		Indian citizen. But there is no reason to submit my proof of citizenship to anybody who desperately needs it.
  	  		It is my liberty and consent to decide whether to provide it or not. If any establishemnt or government felt
  	  		repulsed by this, executing some dumb actions based on despair, then it would be a best proof, that they
  	  		are the perfect examples of dissent supression, & conservational attitude.

		<h3>WHY ? WHY ? WHY ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
			Why am i writing this, when i have other interesting to do ? Basically, i dont like complaining about stuff,
  	  		crying around a problem, without atleast moving a stick or even trying that ! But literally we are in a situation
  	  		where critical thinking and open progressive discussion becoming few and rare. These days common people discussing
  	  		about social, economic, political environment, systems itself is considered as a rebellious attitude by the
  	  		governments and establishments. In India especially, every peaceful protest demonstrated by common people have been
  	  		systematically oppressed, subjugated, hindered since republic. As a result of continuous and cumulative
  	  		thoughts in my mind - sometimes, -- no most of the times -- i ask myself :
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p class="content-blockquote">
  	  		<b>
  	  			am i part of this republic nation that ensured liberty in its constitution ?
  	  			<br>
  	  			am i really living in a democratic republic nation ?
  	  			<br>
  	  			does others feel the same way i do ? "

  	  	<h3>IDENTIFICATION !</h3>
  	  	<p><h4>From NCERT book:</h4></p>
  	  	<p>
			People as a collective entity come into being only through the basic constitution. It is by agreeing to a basic set
  	  		of norms about how one should be governed, and who should be governed that one forms a collective identity.

  	  		<ul>
  	  			<li>
  	  				<p>
	  	  			<b>Political Identity:</b><br>
	  	  				One has many sets of identities that exist prior to a constitution. But by agreeing to certain
	  	  				<u>basic</u> norms and principles one constitutes oneâ€™s basic political identity.
  	  				</p>
  	  			</li>
  	  			<li>
  	  				<p>
  	  				<b>Moral Identity:</b><br>
  	  					Constitutional norms are the overarching framework within which one pursues <u>individual aspirations,
  	  					goals and freedoms</u>. The constitution sets authoritative constraints upon what one may or may not do.
						It defines the fundamental values that we may not trespass. So the constitution also gives one a
  	  					moral identity.
  	  				</p>
  	  			</li>
  	  			<li>
  	  				<p>
  	  				<b>Ethnic Identity:</b><br>
  	  					Indian Consititution, does <u>not</u> make ethnic identity <u>a criterion for Citizenship</u>.
  	  				</p>
  	  			</li>
  	  			<li>
  	  				<p>
  	  				<b>National Identity:</b><br>
  	  					Relationship between different regions of the nation & central government constitutes the
  	  					national identity of the country.
  	  				</p>
  	  			</li>
  	  		</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>THE INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN :</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  		When it comes to a citizen - personal identity is instrumental, as being a part of the socio-economic-political sphere.
  	  		Anyone could have a stand about social, economic, political situation of the society. This stand, could then be
  	  		expressed with the gauranteed fundamental rights & liberties of the constitution. The expression could take any form,
  	  		and thus by nature, cannot be refuted until it is made. Every individual has the right to express their political dissent,
  	  		which collectively plays a key role in the political climate of the society. This is balanced again by the constitutional
  	  		rights. Liberty cannot exist without empathy.
  	  	</p>
