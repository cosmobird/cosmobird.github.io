  	  	<p>Hey there unique id critics, activists, & establishment supporters <b>!</b></p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLAIMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The following are <b>my views</b> about the Unique Id. system implemented in India, which is now branded
  	  		as Aadhaar. I still believe, that having and sharing my views and thoughts, is still possible, with liberties
  	  		gauranteed by Indian Constitution, to its law abiding Citizens, which is fundamentally founted from the
  	  		values of freedom, democracy, liberty, equality, secular nature, civil disobedience... that would rescue me from facing
  	  		police brutality & sedition. Yes, i am legally an Indian citizen. But there is no reason to submit my proof of citizenship
  	  		to anybody who desperately needs it. It is my liberty and consent to decide whether to provide it or not. If any
  	  		establishemnt or government officials, supporters felt repulsed by this, executing some dumb actions based on despair, then
  	  		it would be a best proof, that they are the perfect examples of dissent supression, & of conservational coercion attitude.
  	  	</p>

		<h3>WHY ? WHY ? WHY ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
			Why am i writing this, when i have other interesting to do ? Basically, i dont like complaining about stuff,
  	  		crying around a problem, without atleast moving a stick or even trying that ! But literally we are in a situation
  	  		where critical thinking and open progressive discussion becoming few and rare. These days common people discussing
  	  		about social, economic, political environment, systems itself is considered as a rebellious attitude by the
  	  		governments and establishments. In India especially, every peaceful protest demonstrated by common people have been
  	  		systematically oppressed, subjugated, hindered since republic. As a result of continuous and cumulative
  	  		thoughts in my mind - sometimes, -- no most of the times -- i ask myself :
  	  	</p>

			<h4>TIMELINE</h4>

			<p>
				Thinking about when did i actually started following Aadhaar & UIDAI, i cannot exactly pin
				point the date. As per my personal document collection from mainstream media and internet, it seems
				somewhere around late 2010 i have got so much interested in it. So i thought it would be good to
				have a recorded timeline of events and occurences that have influenced people so much for 10+
				complete years. Obviously, i have collected the data from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar">Wikipedia</a>,
				<a href="http://sflc.in/journey-of-aadhaar/">SFLC</a>,
				<a href="http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/blink/cover/the-aadhaar-of-all-things/article9609603.ece">Hindu business line</a>
				websites & documents which i have collected so far.

			    	<h3>WHAT IS IDENTITY ?</h3>
				<p><h4>From NCERT book:</h4></p>
		  	  	<p>
					People as a collective entity come into being only through the basic constitution. It is by agreeing to a basic set
		  	  		of norms about how one should be governed, and who should be governed that one forms a collective identity.

		  	  		<ul>
		  	  			<li>
		  	  				<p>
			  	  			<b>Political Identity:</b><br>
			  	  				One has many sets of identities that exist prior to a constitution. But by agreeing to certain
			  	  				<u>basic</u> norms and principles one constitutes oneâ€™s basic political identity.
		  	  				</p>
		  	  			</li>
		  	  			<li>
		  	  				<p>
		  	  				<b>Moral Identity:</b><br>
		  	  					Constitutional norms are the overarching framework within which one pursues <u>individual aspirations,
		  	  					goals and freedoms</u>. The constitution sets authoritative constraints upon what one may or may not do.
								It defines the fundamental values that we may not trespass. So the constitution also gives one a
		  	  					moral identity.
		  	  				</p>
		  	  			</li>
		  	  			<li>
		  	  				<p>
		  	  				<b>Ethnic Identity:</b><br>
		  	  					Indian Consititution, does <u>not</u> make ethnic identity <u>a criterion for Citizenship</u>.
		  	  				</p>
		  	  			</li>
		  	  			<li>
		  	  				<p>
		  	  				<b>National Identity:</b><br>
		  	  					Relationship between different regions of the nation & central government constitutes the
		  	  					national identity of the country.
		  	  				</p>
		  	  			</li>
		  	  		</ul>
		  	  	</p>

				<h3>THE COMMON CITIZEN</h3>
		  	  	<p>
		  	  		When it comes to a citizen - personal identity is instrumental, as being a part of the socio-economic-political sphere.
		  	  		Anyone could have a stand about social, economic, political situation of the society. This stand, could then be
		  	  		expressed with the gauranteed fundamental rights & liberties of the constitution. The expression could take any form,
		  	  		and thus by nature, cannot be refuted until it is made. Every individual has the right to express their political dissent,
		  	  		which collectively plays a key role in the political climate of the society. This is balanced again by the constitutional
		  	  		rights. Liberty cannot exist without empathy.
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		The way of expression, need not be limited through suffrage alone in a democracy. It shall take any form of communication,
		  	  		and contributes progressively as long as the expression stays rational. The degree of rationality can only be asserted with
		  	  		the degree of empathy involved in the communication. With the constitution, in a democracy, every individual citizen has the
		  	  		right to dissent and criticize the establishments, organs of governance like executive, legislation and judiciary. Whenever,
		  	  		a citizen felt the tresspass of their fundamental rights, then the constitutional law would stand for rescue. This inturn,
		  	  		intutively declares that the constitution can only gaurantee fundamental rights, when it is rationally defended by the citizens
		  	  		collectively. Democracy and Liberty has to emerge from people, and <u>it must not be expected</u> from the management team or
		  	  		the state. <mark> Only then it is democracy or else its just list of options. </mark>
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		In the context of identity, especially in democratic society like India along with a Union of India - Republic government,
		  	  		right to privacy is inherent within the right to life. This demands one to properly understand <b><i>WHAT IS PRIVACY ?</i></b>
		  	  		in first place. Simply put, <b>HIDING</b> cannot be equated to <b>PRIVACY</b>. I believe that one can establish their
		  	  		political identity through the currently available <mark>voters ID cards.</mark> Any citizen in India, devoid of their
		  	  		economic status can attain one, and based on the current election model, citizens participates in election. Similarly,
		  	  		basic unit of economy, a family has <mark>ration ID cards.</mark> With these and other derived essential ID schemes in place,
		  	  		the <u>management team</u> (government) can provide the promised services. So far, these identification systems, stayed within
		  	  		the balance & never dared to tresspass the fundamental liberty.
		  	  	</p>

				<h3> THE MANAGEMENT</h3></a>
		  	  	<p>
					In simple terms, the governance model in a democratic society can be viewed as management system, that aids for proper
		  	  		functioning of democracy while maintaining itself as a part of the whole. It is very much obvious that any management
		  	  		system no matter to what degree its principles are truthful and sincere. Any institution that does all in its potential
		  	  		to gear towards short term solutions and growth for existing socio-economic problems, might <b>creep in bad practices</b>, which
		  	  		is called <mark>institutional debt</mark>. No institution can empathize each and every one individually and solve the problem
		  	  		from their view point. This necessitates a collective response from the people and then try to solve it with better
		  	  		ideas and concepts, without ever breaching fundamental consitutional principles.
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		Now directly and indirectly, people has to pay for this institutional debt - a cost incurred urgence to solve the problem
		  	  		in a short term. As a result this seeds the vicious cycle of debting and costing that keeps the whole system in dead lock
		  	  		without ever reaching a balance at all.
		  	  	</p>
		    	</section>

		    	<section id="section-topline-2">
			    	<h4>Few logical questions !</h4>
		  	  	<p>
		  	  		Why should people suffer in first place and pay the toll for the institutional debt, for the problems that arises from and
		  	  		present within the institution itself. If a management cannot solve its own problem, then how can people rely on it to solve
		  	  		the societie's problem ? Even when the problem is deeply and widely spread in common, no matter how bigger and powerful is
		  	  		the solution, it is not worth to implement something that is anti-liberty, or anti-constitutional. If state and people are all
		  	  		equal before the law, then the subjugating state, and its anti-constitutional activities has to be restrained.
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		If power of authority is derived from the collective extraction of responsibility from the voted citizens, then how come the
		  	  		authority can override its source of power in first place ?
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p class="content-blockquote">
		  	    	  	<b>Declaration of Independence (India)</b> : <br>
		  	    	  	<i>if any government deprives a people of their rights and oppresses them, the people have a further right to alter it or
		  	    	  	to abolish it.</i>
		  	    	</p>

				<h3>ACCUMULATION :</h3>
				<p>
			  		Thus no matter how many powerful identification schemes the government tries to establish and push it to people, so that it can
			  		ease its operation and duty, the <mark>people has the right to dissent</mark> it. It has to be remembered, that <b>Unjust Law</b> do exist
			  		and a <u>rational</u> set of people, has the <u>right and duty to associate against such unjust laws and acts</u>. Accumulation of these
					these unjust laws, acts as the subjugative source for the state, which in first place have occured because of irrational,
					unthoughtful, short-term solutions, which erodes and deprives democracy from within, leaving behind only cold authoritarianism.
			  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		Such conditions serves as the means to do whatever the established institutions, individuals, bureaucrats, plutocrats, technocrats, ...
					wants to do. This will enroll the whole system to a periodic and frequent short-term solutions, crisis and problems that keeps pounding on
		  	  		the society itself. This eventually constructs a vicious cycle, which is a a result of ignorance about democracy, absence of -- participation
		  	  		in democracy. Management instead of making the society self organizable and self managemeable and dissolve itself later, seems to
		  	  		continue in perpetuity. Definetely the current bearing of government is not towards it. <mark> People being reduced from citizens to subjects
					to objects to commodities becomes normative as part and parcel of the effect. </mark>
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<h3> PERSPECTIVE OF IDENTIFICATION :</h3>
		  	  	<p>
		  	  		One has to be aware what identification is, and what is actually not. Furthermore, people needs to know when identification
		  	  		is required and who shall initiate the identification in first place. A clarity is necessary to understand the suttle differences,
		  	  		which eradicates the misuse of identification systems. Following are the points i learned from identification systems. It is
		  	  		always safe and just to look from an individuals perspective when it comes to identification. Technology can be present, but
		  	  		not at the expense of individuals liberty and violation of fundamentally gauranteed consitutional rights, principles and directives.

		  	  		<ul>
		  	  			<li>Id. is not a simple asset or commodity</li>
		  	  			<li>Id. Need not be queried & verified from state</li>
		  	  			<li>Id. Need to be with the individual</li>
		  	  			<li>Id. can only be requested by the state, that too after stating the probable cause</li>
		  	  			<li>Id. is an interface between personal and social spheres</li>
		  	  			<li>Id. must not enable surveillance</li>
		  	  			<li>Id. Technology cannot solve socio-economic problems</li>
		  	  			<li>Id. is not a commodity</li>
		  	  			<li>Unique Numbering might result in chronic misusage</li>
		  	  		</ul>
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<h3>So ? ... What's the problem ?</h3>
		  	  	<p>
		  	  		One shall easily see where unique numbering is usually deployed ? To understand the seriousness of the unique
		  	  		identification, one can compare and contrast the existing systems where unique id. has already been in place.
		  	  		<i>(which i personally see has a certain degree of coerciveness to them)</i>. Around us, we have seen them in
		  	  		the following scenarios :

		  	  		<ul>
		  	  			<li><h4>In products:</h4>
		  	  				<p>
		  	  					Mostly we see them in packages, consumer products, devices and machines that one purchases,
		  	  					that take ownership on. Any two objects which are highly similar can only be discriminated
		  	  					by only using a unique number generated through some means during production, and packaging
		  	  					process.
		  	  				</p>
		  	  			</li>
		  	  			<li><h4>In Controlled Parks:</h4>
		  	  				<p>
		  	  					Other case is that, for wildlife, preservation and monitoring of their population, sancturies &
		  	  					national parks usually involve numbering the species to collect data, profile their behavior,
		  	  					to understand their interactions with each other, ... etc.
		  	  				</p>
		  	  			</li>
		  	  			<li><h4>In Jails/Prisons:</h4>
							<p>
								Also we know that people in prisons are numbered. This makes it easy for counting, identifying,
								surveilling, and managing as a whole group, that actually reduces the pain of management
								and administration. Rules have definetely eased management and it is possible, because it is in
								the prison.
							</p>
		  	  			</li>
		  	  			<li><h4>In Emergency Environments:</h4>
		  	  				<p>
		  	  					People would be numbered in large scale hospitals. Again this would enable the management to
		  	  					automate certain process that could help keep the hospitalized (ill) people safe and secure.
		  	  					During emergency situations this helps in maintaining the order of the process dictated to
		  	  					make sure the system operates without any emotional disturbances.
		  	  				</p>
		  	  			</li>
		  	  			<li><h4>In Examinations:</h4>
		  	  				<p>
		  	  					When people are examined strictly as a formal process to test them for their talent or anything
		  	  					else, usually involves supplying a unique identification number to make sure the test is
		  	  					executed without any malpractice. Anybody can be subjected for inspection by squads and examiners
		  	  					without the need for consent. Only the authority has the deciding power till the exam duration.
		  	  					(this is the case atleast in India).
		  	  				</p>
		  	  			</li>
		  	  		</ul>
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		My argument is not about the pragmatic usage of numbering and unique identification, but about the psychological
		  	  		effect that such a scheme would create in the authority or whoever tries to push it. It has to be noted, that unique
		  	  		identification so far has only accompanied with technology that provides completely centralized and obscure control
		  	  		over the id's. When somebody is numbered and uniquely identified with it, they <mark>cease to exist as a human,</mark>
		  	  		and reduced to just a number in a list. <mark>A government enforcing</mark> such scheme by advertising and endorsing the
		  	  		embedded pragmatic advantage has just <mark>reduced itself from benevolent governance to brutal warden.</mark>
		  	  		We reduce ourselves from a welfare society, to just a controlled environment where anything can be experimented without
		  	  		our consent.
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		How come the above situations are different from whatever scheme a central authrority provides and promises ? One can
		  	  		easily understand, that a numbering system always comes with neglecting liberty and pushing subjugation, in the name of
		  	  		pragmatism. Is it not disturbing to treat each others as commodities, and reduce ourselves to let subjugate ourselves.
		  	  		At the end of the day, government is run by common people mostly who are already busy with their daily routine to survive
		  	  		and to earn a decent monthly wage to feed their families. Does Unique Identification, is that worth to keep it deployed ?
		  	  	</p>

		    		</p>

		    		<h4>Forced Social Capital Gain:</h4>
		    		<p>
					We have to accept that UIDAI, has really innovated from the extreme corporate cultures of digital world,
		    			and dared to bluntly apply to a vast democratic nation - India. Since most of the people are ignorants
		    			<mark>( yes they are intelligent than us, and we are bunch of fools and sheeps ).</mark> So far, it cannot
		    			be denied, that technocrats have achieved it in one way or another. They have definetely inspired further
		    			subugative regimes to adapt the <b>Mandatorily Volunteering</b> mechanism to reap power from the people
		    			easily. Personally, i see it as a political innovation on how to mobilize themselves by immobilizing the
		    			criticisms and actions against them and their extremist ideologies.
		    		</p>

		    		<p>
					Only few factors are necessary to implement such mechanism. The people has to be :

		    			<ul>
		    				<li>under constant fear of war, national security threat, terrorism</li>
		    				<li>busy with daily life and stay ignorant about broader things and systems</li>
		    				<li>often mobilize police brutality to show "who is the master around here ?"</li>
		    				<li>stop providing rightful and deserved service if people do not comply</li>
		    				<li>never make them leave once they fall prey for subjugation</li>
		    			</ul>
		    		</p>

		    		<p>
		    			People accumulated through such dreadful strategy seems to work in country like India. Even when UIDAI/Aadhaar
		    			has not used all of them, it has used atleast some of it and might use all if needed in future. That is how
		    			UIDAI have earned the <mark>" inclusive "</mark> social density through its enrollment mechanism.

		    			for understanding not only about any act like Aadhaar, but it also about listening to the actors, players, thinkers,
		    			researchers who help understand the connections between government policies and socio-economic and political
		    			crisis. I am going to listen and learn from the personalities i know around in the space of Aadhaar and its influence.
		    			This would help me and you to see the points, what people are thinking, why are they thinking so, and what is their
		    			bearing about the issue.

		    		<h3>What is Needed ?</h3>
		    		<p>
		    			Clearly people are angry about both crisis in governance as well as modern threat to their fundamental rights.
		    			They question the purpose of constitution, the purpose of governance in first place. Everybody wants to
		    			solve problem in their <b>own ways and beliefs</b>, where <b>bias and motivational reasoning</b> would be
		    			abundant, which will result in creating vicious cycles of problems rather than democratic solutions. We
		    			have to understand that solution is not goal here, but also <b>the way of the solution</b> proposed,
		    			implemented, executed to cooperatively solve the problem with peoples participation is the actual goal. That
		    			must motivate us, provide the impetus for faith, desire to mobilize, with democratic means without any
		    			coercion and paternal character.
		    		</p>

		    		<p>
		    			Having a technology is not the solution. Technology is intertwined with the society. People getting misused,
		    			either because of their ignorance, does not mean that government can exploit the ignorance to leverage it to
		    			execute its paternal attitude. Furthermore, if technology seems to be provide ultimate solution, why do we need
		    			civil societies, parliamentary deliberations, apex courts, civil participation, consitution ? We have to realize
		    			that technolgoy can be part of the solution. We have to accept it. <b>Believing that technology is the solution
		    			is bit extreme and indicates the ignorance of socio-economic history manking faced till now.</b> Whoever worked
		    			with science and technology will definetely accept that technology is not just what we have in hand, it is
		    			accumulation of practices, innovations, skills, labour, and techniques derived from them.

			  			<p>
							We have to realize and accept that despite being a <b>Socialistic</b> economy as stated in the preamble of our
			  				constitution, we are living on a quagmire of market economy characterized by capitalistic and neoliberal
			  				attitudes. With a non-democratic, but market and profit, power focused economy, growth and development are
			  				always flowing towards only a few, which in turn again makes the few rich, and powerful as they already are.
			  				This creates a polarized dichotomy in our national economy.
			  			</p>

		  				<p>
		  					In such a socio-economic machinery, and politics learning towards paternal authoritarian extremes, it is apt to
		  					expect reduction of democracy into totalitarian state with the <mark>loss of moral auhority</mark>. In a
		  					society totally driven and influenced by selfish-interest based economy, that plutocracy, technocracy and all
		  					other feudal characteristics that over powers a few will always mix up that severly reduces people from
		  					citizens to serfs to objects to numbers. This has lead to not only socio-economic crisis but also infrastructural,
		  					governance, & political crisis.
		  				</p>

		  				<p>
		  					Somewhere, along the line we have lost the political appetite and balls to stand up to our collectively declared
		  					constitution, that have initiated socialistic welfare systems like <b>Cooperatives</b>, decentralization and grassroot
		  					community support. Instead of being progressive political parties and government in general are regressive. State
		  					promotes itself into <mark>police state</mark>, <mark>opaque state</mark> and <mark>mass surveillance state</mark> whenever
		  					the chances occur, leveraging on the people's fear, and even instill fear of war, terrorism, national security threat,
		  					etc... This attitude and practice, eventually breaks the checks and balances enshrined by founding fathers of independent
		  					and republic India.

			  			<p>
							Governance in India, as mostly experienced by most of us is mostly opaque, huge, complex management & administration system,
			  				for a common citizen. Citizens cannot openly participate in the transparent governance process. It is authoritative
			  				in structure. Government forming the burecratic and executive organs have stopped being servants of people and instead
			  				assumed itself as powerful master. Such is indicated clearly by the subjugative policies, acts, systems of surveillance
			  				over public communication kept in place, support and acceleration for UIDAI like schemes even in unconstitutional and unethical
			  				way in the name of "greater good". It is always the "greater good" uttered by the oppressive regimes before converting
			  				the democracy into a functional authoritative government that little by little amends the constitution to exercise absolute
			  				power over the people.
			  			</p>

		  				<p>
		  					We do exactly have such governance crisis, where it serves the few but oppresses the common majority of citizens, of middle
		  					class and poor who are actually the yielding grounds for the corporate monopolies, feudalists, plutocrats, technocrats, etc...
		  					Always subsidies are more for bigger and bigger corporates. UIDAI can be illustrated as one best example of how system of
		  					governance shows partiality fueled by political and financial power. UIDAI never have been properly deliberated in parliamentary
		  					houses before it started interacting with other systems. UIDAI has been enforced through Aadhaar act 2016 through a Finance Bill
		  					in a improper way. Our government is so famous for instigating police force as just pawns in the socio-political game between
		  					the people and itself. It has <mark>always been a key in enforcing unjust laws</mark> and thereby modulating the consitution with an
		  					unjust amendment, which would create irreversible repercussions thereafter.
		  				</p>

		  				<p>
		  					It seems, as if that government wants immunity through opaqueness against transparency and accountability which people are exercising
		  					through Right To Information. It enacts subjugative systems like NATGRID, CMS, UIDAI... to make the citizen more transparent in turn
		  					making itself more and more opaque. This is a clear indication of inversal of democracy. Our government and political powers never
		  					accepts that most of the corruption, "leakage", "pilferage", "duplication" were happening with themself and wanted to impose such
		  					complaints on the people alone, thereby facilitating their stand for unique identification to eradicate corruption, security threat,
		  					theft - as if they are not the ones doing it. There are only a very few systems like MNREGA that has <b>social auditing</b> inbuilt
		  					in it.

				    			with common sense, or atleast a few years experience in technology can think about it, such that there are other social,
				    			economical barricades that can be removed in first place without racing based on over confidence in technology. Failure of
				    			a project is bearable, whereas failure of democracy due to half baked and over honoured technology will put lead to modern
				    			totalitarian rule. Such fast forwarding solutions also might bring <mark>irreversible situations.</mark>
				    		</p>

				    		<p>
				    			If a <mark>rational being</mark> is to solve the economic problem pertaining to delivery of public goods, services & benefits
				    			to people, it would have been atleast in the following order:

				    			<ol>
				    				<li><mark>Support</mark> & bring consitutional law securing individuals <u>right to privacy</u> & information confidentiality</li>
				    				<li>Decentralize Electricity generation using Cooperative Renewable Energy Systems</li>
				    				<li>Decentralize Communication infrastructure using Cooperative Community Networks</li>
				    				<li>Do extensive transparent research on peoples consumption pattern</li>
				    				<li>Do study non-biometric based identification feasibility study</li>
				    				<li>Openly create socially auditable technology for people participation in governance</li>
				    				<li>Educate people to participate in the 100% open development process</li>
				    			</ol>
				    		</p>

				    		<p>
				    			Moreover governments, bureaucrats, politicians must stop <b>over honouring</b> celebrities, business stalwarts,
				    			technology behemoths, corporate luminaries and must start really thinking before handling social responsibilities
				    			over to them, just because they are <i>"successful"</i> in their business. Its common sense, to learn that such
				    			a process is not at all democratic. People elect representatives, but in whose power, representatives can appoint
				    			personalities without ever communicating to people or even without a public deliberation ? This will create a
				    			serious polarized dichotomy in politically, socially and economically.
				    		</p>

				    		<p>
				    			Pertaining to Aadhaar, establishing a privacy law must have been a proper democracy respecting governance action,
				    			instead of <b>"lets exploit and bring order"</b> attitude. Such attitude clearly, indicates that government
				    			expects and coerces people to be completely transparent and making itself more opaque than ever. This is not a
				    			democratic governance but a totalitarian governance in action.
				    		</p>

				    		<p>
				    			Probably for Mr. Nandan M. Nilekani who came from a well established, capitalistic model of doing business &
				    			managing people who work for it, where everything is centralized, hierarchially controlled in a top down
				    			fashion the solution would be realizable in a centralized way only. That would be his view and those who accept
				    			such views may be grouped together as a set of volunteers who look the world in their views. They might be
				    			<b>OK</b> in compromising some of their liberties - as they see it as a barricade in implementing a workable
				    			solution. For others, like me it is a <mark><b>NOT</b> OK</mark>. There are people who would not willing to
				    			sacrifice their liberty and privacy. It is a matter of principle and not pragmatism.
				    		</p>

				    		<p>
				    			People who have been into real science and technology would already have learned about FOSS, FOSH realms,
				    			peer production, alternative economies, decentralization, cryptography, etc... If some how, the Aadhaar team
				    			has not looked into it, then it indicates their ignorance or atleast incompetance in leveraging such frameworks
				    			to create tools pertaining to it for the problem in hand. Perhaps, the following video as an example would
				    			be an example to illustrate : why active participation and economic transaction does not need unique identification ;
				    			does not need centralization in control... etc...

		  					<mark>let the people have control over their information <b>==</b> privacy.</mark> If UIDAI technical team, directors,
