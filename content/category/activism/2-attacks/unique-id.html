  	  	<p>Hey there unique id critics, activists, & establishment supporters <b>!</b></p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLAIMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The following are <b>my views</b> about the Unique Id. system implemented in India, which is now branded
  	  		as Aadhaar. I still believe, that having and sharing my views and thoughts, is still possible, with liberties
  	  		gauranteed by Indian Constitution, to its law abiding Citizens, which is fundamentally founted from the
  	  		values of freedom, democracy, liberty, equality, secular nature, civil disobedience... that would rescue me from facing
  	  		police brutality & sedition. Yes, i am legally an Indian citizen. But there is no reason to submit my proof of citizenship
  	  		to anybody who desperately needs it. It is my liberty and consent to decide whether to provide it or not. If any
  	  		establishemnt or government officials, supporters felt repulsed by this, executing some dumb actions based on despair, then
  	  		it would be a best proof, that they are the perfect examples of dissent supression, & of conservational coercion attitude.
  	  	</p>

		<h3>WHY ? WHY ? WHY ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
			Why am i writing this, when i have other interesting to do ? Basically, i dont like complaining about stuff,
  	  		crying around a problem, without atleast moving a stick or even trying that ! But literally we are in a situation
  	  		where critical thinking and open progressive discussion becoming few and rare. These days common people discussing
  	  		about social, economic, political environment, systems itself is considered as a rebellious attitude by the
  	  		governments and establishments. In India especially, every peaceful protest demonstrated by common people have been
  	  		systematically oppressed, subjugated, hindered since republic. As a result of continuous and cumulative
  	  		thoughts in my mind - sometimes, -- no most of the times -- i ask myself :
  	  	</p>

  	  	<blockquote>
  	  			<br>am i part of this republic nation that ensured liberty in its constitution ?<br>
  	  			am i really living in a socialist democratic republic nation ?<br>
  	  			does others feel the same way i do ?

							People as a collective entity come into being only through the basic constitution. It is by agreeing to a basic set
				  	  		of norms about how one should be governed, and who should be governed that one forms a collective identity.

				  	  		<ul>
				  	  			<li>
				  	  				<p>
					  	  			<b>Political Identity:</b><br>
					  	  				One has many sets of identities that exist prior to a constitution. But by agreeing to certain
					  	  				<u>basic</u> norms and principles one constitutes oneâ€™s basic political identity.
				  	  				</p>
				  	  			</li>
				  	  			<li>
				  	  				<p>
				  	  				<b>Moral Identity:</b><br>
				  	  					Constitutional norms are the overarching framework within which one pursues <u>individual aspirations,
				  	  					goals and freedoms</u>. The constitution sets authoritative constraints upon what one may or may not do.
										It defines the fundamental values that we may not trespass. So the constitution also gives one a
				  	  					moral identity.

		  				<h4>Social Identity:</h4>
			  			<p>
							Type of identities listed above in NCERT book are the identities that have the purpose of social interaction with the people
			  				and the systems surrounding the individual. Primary purpose that these identities founts from the acceptance of
			  				common set of principles which the people agreed to live upon. So whenever a identity is requested based on a probably
			  				cause by the people or authority from the government, then the individual shall produce the document/card/number that
			  				directs to their social identity (think drivers license, passport, ration card, PAN card...). So we shall safely call these
			  				kind of identities as <b>Social Identity.</b>
			  			</p>

		  				<p>
							Usually social identity are generated based on readily visible, recognizable factors (think photograph...). Afterall, humans
		  					interact with each other mostly based on visual communication. We are well aware that communication requires
		  					identification. Uniqueness in identification for establishing a proper communication is derived from interaction.
		  				</p>

				  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>where identity founts from ?</i></b></figcaption>
				  	  	</figure>

		  				<h4>Personal Identity:</h4>
		  				<p>
		  					On the other hand, <b>Personal Identity</b> is not only inherently unique, but also personal in nature. The uniqueness
		  					in this case is derived from the privately physical, biological, behavioral patterns. Such factors falls within the
		  					opaque private sphere of the individual person, which they will not compromise with sense. This is where abstract
		  					concepts like mental and bodily integrity founts from, that further gauranteed not to be tresspassed by systems
		  					outside the personal sphere - by the constitution in a democratic nation. The privacy here is actually the phenomenon of
		  					control over such traits. Since, the person is not willing to expose their <mark>introspective</mark> interactions, it
		  					is represented abstractly such as personality, intimacy, right to left alone, right to have confidentiality, anonymity,
		  					right to have secrecy, right to have faith & desires over their thought process and their life in general. A democratic
		  					governance cannot penetrate through such walls.
		  				</p>

		  				<h4>NOTE:</h4>
		  				<p>
		  					<ul>
		  						<li>personal identity can be unique, but deeply intertwined with personal liberty, which shall not be tresspassed by any external influences.</li>
		  						<li>personal identity by birth nature everyone has got some or more unique forms (think personas) manifested physically, biologically & mentally.</li>
		  						<li>personal identity cannot limit itself to biometric information and includes behaviometric information too.</li>
		  						<li>social identity is a agreed form of identification between the individual and society, that helps for mutual identification.</li>
		  						<li>social identity is either provided or requested in order to access a public benefit or service from the governance.</li>
		  						<li><u>transferring</u> key identification <mark>traits</mark> <u>from individual sphere to social sphere</u>, will <mark>cause irreversible damage to personal liberty.</mark></li>

		  			<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-who-controls-id"><h3>Who controls the Identification ?</h3></a>
		  			<div id="accordion-who-controls-id" class="accordion-section-content">

		  				<p>
		  					Any Identification information <mark>cannot be easily categorized</mark> as personal/private id. or social id. Measuring the
		  					degree of uniqueness varies with cultural history of the locale. However, in a democratic society, what is enshrined in the
		  					constiution cannot be overriden by unjust powers in action - and it is upto the people of the nation to decide to collectively
		  					decide what are all the information can be classified as personal/private and the rest shall be taken as socially identifiable
		  					information. So, in general the set of information which would be valued with proximity towards personal values can be
		  					considered as privtae id. Such information would obviously have higher degree of uniqueness.
		  				</p>

				  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>Identity cannot be easily categorized, thus being anti-ignorant about who is in control and how identification is done is vital</i></b></figcaption>
				  	  	</figure>

			  			<p>
							When it comes to the process of identifying somebody through some means, it usually involves two key questions :

			  				<ul>
			  					<li>who is in control of identification ?</li>
			  					<li>how the process of identification is executed ?</li>
			  				</ul>
			  			</p>

		  				<p>
							Identification process can be safely and simply modeled as a process of transaction of information, between two parties.
							It is safe to assume that somebody or some authority might <u>request</u> for identification with reasons of probable cause,
		  					that intiates the process of transaction of identity information. It is basically a process of confirming whether me is me
		  					at that time and place by another person - might be an authority in this case.
		  				</p>

		  				<h4>Individual controls Identification:</h4>

		  				<figure>
				  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/illustrations/uniqueid-aadhaar/identity-individual.png" alt="individual-in-control">
				  	  	</figure>

		  				<p>
		  					This process applies to both socially identifiable information and uniquely identifiable personal information (if the situation
		  					requires it). In both the cases, the personal information tied to my personal sphere, cannot be taken away from me. Thus i
		  					would be in control of my personal information.
		  				</p>

		  				<h4>Third party controls Identification:</h4>
		  				<p>
							With the probabilistic nature of identification, there is no absolute way of identifying somebody with the provided social identity
		  					information. With the practical errors introduced in the identity generation process, due to wrong data, data that does not complies
		  					with age, etc... which is where the requirement of a robust unique identification system has found its actual use. Uniqueness can
		  					be derived either by using mathematical techniques(cryptography) seeded with the individual provided data or by penetrating the personal liberty to
		  					extract unique information from biometrics or behaviometrics, added with cryptography.
		  				</p>

		  				<figure>
				  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/illustrations/uniqueid-aadhaar/identity-thirdparty.png" alt="middleman-in-control">
				  	  	</figure>

		  				<h4>NOTE:</h4>
		  				<p>
		  					The architecture of identification plays a central role. <u>People has to be vigilent to check</u> how the uniqueness in the identification is
		  					derived :

		  					<ul>
		  						<li>by exploiting their private information and using cryptography over the extracted info.</li>
		  						<li>by using publicly identifiable unique information (think email id) with cryptography.</li>
		  						<li>in the end, who uses the private info./key and who uses the public info./key.</li>
		  					</ul>
		  				</p>

		  				<p>
		  					<mark>Having a unique identification with non transparent <b>+</b> centralized private info/key data base will lead to :</mark>

		  						<ol>
		  							<li>Irreversible risk of Single point of failure of highly attractive private key/info.</li>
		  							<li>People to have blind faith on the systems administrators.</li>
		  							<li>Bad security model and practice - security through obscurity.</li>
		  							<li>High cost involved in maintaining the service, infrastructure.</li>
		  							<li>Honey pot of streisand effect for digital crackers, compounding cost for establishing further layers of obscurity.</li>
		  							<li>Renewing information for accomodating changes in identification, will make people objects of the system.</li>
		  							<li>Who has complete control over the central id. database, will eventually have more responsibility and unmeasured power.</li>
		  						</ol>
		  				</p>

		  				<h4>PERSONAL THOUGHT:</h4>
		  				<p>
		  					Thinking about uniqueness, anything that one can be isolated from the rest can be set as unique. That is how modern panopticon systems
		  					work by applying persuasive soft powers where the majority falls for simple psychological play. Observing behavior, recording,
		  					tracking and in turn enjoying emotionally satisfying service is what people of this era seems to ask for. But considering only ignorants
		  					is partial. So, if the pace of personal intrusion, surveillance continues to extract uniqueness from biometric and behavior tracking,
		  					then it would be very much possible to see rationally that dna, ear shapes, vein spread, penis size, breast size, distance between nipples,
		  					foot pronation, voice, gait, etc... along with palm print, finger prints, iris, can be used to extract more and more uniqueness to get more
		  					efficient identification and authentication system more reliable - so that we can access righfully deserved services.
		  				</p>

		  				<p>
		  					Wait a minute ! am i being bit rude and extreme here... ? may be ! but i cannot help it, that is how my mind extrapolates to see what
		  					can go wrong atleast in theory and thought experiments.

				<h3>COMMON CITIZEN</h3>
		  	  	<p>
		  	  		When it comes to a citizen - personal identity is instrumental, as being a part of the socio-economic-political sphere.
		  	  		Anyone could have a stand about social, economic, political situation of the society. This stand, could then be
		  	  		expressed with the gauranteed fundamental rights & liberties of the constitution. The expression could take any form,
		  	  		and thus by nature, cannot be refuted until it is made. Every individual has the right to express their political dissent,
		  	  		which collectively plays a key role in the political climate of the society. This is balanced again by the constitutional
		  	  		rights. Liberty cannot exist without empathy.
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		The way of expression, need not be limited through suffrage alone in a democracy. It shall take any form of communication,
		  	  		and contributes progressively as long as the expression stays rational. The degree of rationality can only be asserted with
		  	  		the degree of empathy involved in the communication. With the constitution, in a democracy, every individual citizen has the
		  	  		right to dissent and criticize the establishments, organs of governance like executive, legislation and judiciary. Whenever,
		  	  		a citizen felt the tresspass of their fundamental rights, then the constitutional law would stand for rescue. This inturn,
		  	  		intutively declares that the constitution can only gaurantee fundamental rights, when it is rationally defended by the citizens
		  	  		collectively. Democracy and Liberty has to emerge from people, and <u>it must not be expected</u> from the management team --
		  	  		the state. <mark> Only then it is democracy or else its just list of options. </mark>
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		In the context of identity, especially in democratic society like India along with a Union of India - Republic government,
		  	  		right to privacy is inherent within the right to life. This demands one to properly understand <b><i>WHAT IS PRIVACY ?</i></b>
		  	  		in first place. Simply put, <b>HIDING</b> cannot be equated to <b>PRIVACY</b>. I believe that one can establish their
		  	  		political identity through the currently available <mark>voters ID cards.</mark> Any citizen in India, devoid of their
		  	  		economic status can attain one, and based on the current election model, citizens participates in election. Similarly,
		  	  		basic unit of economy, a family has <mark>ration ID cards.</mark> With these and other derived essential ID schemes in place,
		  	  		the <u>management team</u> (government) can provide the promised services. So far, these identification systems, stayed within
		  	  		the balance & never dared to tresspass the fundamental liberty.
		  	  	</p>

				<h3>MANAGEMENT</h3></a>
		  	  	<p>
					In simple terms, the governance model in a democratic society can be viewed as management system, that aids for proper
		  	  		functioning of democracy while maintaining itself as a part of the whole. It is very much obvious that any management
		  	  		system no matter to what degree its principles are truthful and sincere. Any institution that does all in its potential
		  	  		to gear towards short term solutions and growth for existing socio-economic problems, might <b>creep in bad practices</b>, which
		  	  		is called <mark>institutional debt</mark>. No institution can empathize each and every one individually and solve the problem
		  	  		from their view point. This necessitates a collective response from the people and then try to solve it with better
		  	  		ideas and concepts, without ever breaching fundamental consitutional principles.
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		Now directly and indirectly, people has to pay for this institutional debt - a cost incurred urgence to solve the problem
		  	  		in a short term. As a result this seeds the vicious cycle of debting and costing that keeps the whole system in dead lock
		  	  		without ever reaching a balance at all.
		  	  	</p>
		    	</section>



		  	<!-- GETTING A PERSPECTIVE ABOUT IDENTITY -->
		    	<section id="section-topline-2">
		  	  	<p>
		  	  		Why should people suffer in first place and pay the toll for the institutional debt, for the problems that arises from and
		  	  		present within the institution itself. If a management cannot solve its own problem, then how can people rely on it to solve
		  	  		the societie's problem ? Even when the problem is deeply and widely spread in common, no matter how bigger and powerful is
		  	  		the solution, it is not worth to implement something that is anti-liberty, or anti-constitutional. If state and people are all
		  	  		equal before the law, then the subjugating state, and its anti-constitutional activities has to be restrained.
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		If power of authority is derived from the collective extraction of responsibility from the voted citizens, then how come the
		  	  		authority can override its source of power in first place ?
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<blockquote>
		  	    	  	if any government deprives a people of their rights and oppresses them, the people have a further right to alter it or
		  	    	  	to abolish it.

		  	  		<p data-type="attribution">
		  	  			- Declaration of Independence (India)
		  	  		</p>
		  	    	</blockquote>

				<h3>ACCUMULATION :</h3>
				<p>
			  		Thus no matter how many powerful identification schemes the government tries to establish and push it to people, so that it can
			  		ease its operation and duty, the <mark>people has the right to dissent</mark> it. It has to be remembered, that <b>Unjust Law</b> do exist
			  		and a <u>rational</u> set of people, has the <u>right and duty to associate against such unjust laws and acts</u>. Accumulation of these
					these unjust laws, acts as the subjugative source for the state, which in first place have occured because of irrational,
					unthoughtful, short-term solutions, which erodes and deprives democracy from within, leaving behind only cold authoritarianism.
			  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		Such conditions serves as the means to do whatever the established institutions, individuals, bureaucrats, plutocrats, technocrats, ...
					wants to do. This will enroll the whole system to a periodic and frequent short-term solutions, crisis and problems that keeps pounding on
		  	  		the society itself. This eventually constructs a vicious cycle, which is a a result of ignorance about democracy, absence of -- participation
		  	  		in democracy. Management, instead of helping the society self organizable and self managemeable and dissolve itself later, seems to
		  	  		continue in perpetuity. Definetely the current bearing of government is not towards it. <mark> People being reduced from citizens to subjects
					to objects to commodities becomes normative as part and parcel of the effect. </mark>
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<h3> PERSPECTIVE OF IDENTIFICATION :</h3>
		  	  	<p>
		  	  		One has to be aware what identification is, and what is actually not. Furthermore, people needs to know when identification
		  	  		is required and who shall initiate the identification in first place. A clarity is necessary to understand the suttle differences,
		  	  		which eradicates the misuse of identification systems. Following are the points i learned from identification systems. It is
		  	  		always safe and just to look from an individuals perspective when it comes to identification. Technology can be present, but
		  	  		not at the expense of individuals liberty and violation of fundamentally gauranteed consitutional rights, principles and directives.

		  	  		<ul>

		  	  			<li>Uniqueness from biological/behavior uniqueness, is intrusion to personal & bodily integrity</li>
		  	  		</ul>
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<h3>So ? ... What's the problem ?</h3>
		  	  	<p>
		  	  		One shall easily see where unique numbering is usually deployed ? To understand the seriousness of the unique
		  	  		identification, one can compare and contrast the existing systems where unique id. has already been in place.
		  	  		<i>(which i personally see has a certain degree of coerciveness to them)</i>. Around us, we have seen them in
		  	  		the following scenarios :

		  	  		<ul>
		  	  			<li><h4>In products:</h4>
		  	  				<p>
		  	  					Mostly we see them in packages, consumer products, devices and machines that one purchases,
		  	  					that take ownership on. Any two objects which are highly similar can only be discriminated
		  	  					by only using a unique number generated through some means during production, and packaging
		  	  					process.
		  	  				</p>
		  	  			</li>
		  	  			<li><h4>In Controlled Parks:</h4>
		  	  				<p>
		  	  					Other case is that, for wildlife, preservation and monitoring of their population, sancturies &
		  	  					national parks usually involve numbering the species to collect data, profile their behavior,
		  	  					to understand their interactions with each other, ... etc.
		  	  				</p>
		  	  			</li>
		  	  			<li><h4>In Jails/Prisons:</h4>
							<p>
								Also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_in_Nazi_camps">we know that people
								in prisons are numbered for unique identification</a>. This makes it easy for counting, identifying,
								surveilling, segregating, isolating, and managing the whole group, that actually reduces the pain
								of management and administration. Rules have definetely eased management and it is possible, because
								proximity of influence is within the prison.
							</p>
		  	  			</li>
		  	  			<li><h4>In Emergency Environments:</h4>
		  	  				<p>
		  	  					People would be numbered in large scale hospitals. Again this would enable the management to
		  	  					automate certain process that could help keep the hospitalized (ill) people safe and secure.
		  	  					During emergency situations this helps in maintaining the order of the process dictated to
		  	  					make sure the system operates without any emotional disturbances.
		  	  				</p>
		  	  			</li>
		  	  			<li><h4>In Examinations:</h4>
		  	  				<p>
		  	  					When people are examined strictly as a formal process to test them for their talent or anything
		  	  					else, usually involves supplying a unique identification number to make sure the test is
		  	  					executed without any malpractice. Anybody can be subjected for inspection by squads and examiners
		  	  					without the need for consent. Only the authority has the deciding power till the exam duration.
		  	  					(this is the case atleast in India).
		  	  				</p>
		  	  			</li>
		  	  		</ul>
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		My argument is not about the pragmatic usage of numbering and unique identification, but about the psychological
		  	  		effect that such a scheme would create in the authority or whoever tries to push it. It has to be noted, that unique
		  	  		identification so far has only accompanied with technology that provides completely centralized and obscure control
		  	  		over the id's. When somebody is numbered and uniquely identified with it, they <mark>cease to exist as a human,</mark>
		  	  		and reduced to just a number in a list. <mark>A government enforcing</mark> such scheme by advertising and endorsing the
		  	  		embedded pragmatic advantage has just <mark>reduced itself from benevolent governance to brutal warden.</mark>
		  	  		We reduce ourselves from a welfare society, to just a controlled environment where anything can be experimented without
		  	  		our consent.
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		How come the above situations are different from whatever scheme a central authrority provides and promises ? One can
		  	  		easily understand, that a numbering system always comes with neglecting liberty and pushing subjugation, in the name of
		  	  		pragmatism. Is it not disturbing to treat each others as commodities, and reduce ourselves to let subjugate ourselves.
		  	  		At the end of the day, government is run by common people mostly who are already busy with their daily routine to survive
		  	  		and to earn a decent monthly wage to feed their families. Does Unique Identification, is that worth to keep it deployed ?
		  	  	</p>

							Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), a statutory authority established on 12 July 2016 by the Government of India,
				    			under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, under the provisions of the Aadhaar Act 2016. As one could
				    			see in the above timeline, UIDAI is established in a circumvential way avoiding direct questions. Simply said, it has not
				    			faced proper deliberation process in houses of parliament. It was initiated just like that by establishing an office
				    			in Delhi, and started executing its operations and actively interacting with the other systems and institutions of governance.
				    		</p>

				    		<p>
				    			Only after significant uprise and strong feedback, perhaps with delay - government then provided a statuatory support for it. The
				    			delay in the process is easily hijacked by the office and its team, to roll out tests, persuade through technical brand, euphemism,
				    			& political influence. Furthermore, <mark>how <b>(means)</b> the statuatory support is established does really matters.</mark> If
				    			such process is abnormal, then we people has to be be aware and pay more attention to why such a unethical and unconstitutional
				    			push is done ?

				    			neither any social problems or even the economic problems can be solved in such way, and always history of technology has its limits
				    			at that point of time, from which innovation and logics in social, economic and political sciences would involve and help realize the
				    			solution practically. As far as i know, such blind belief is just equivalent to follow a religion.

				    			It is the technical definition of Aadhaar act, and has been the claimed goal of the whole UIDAI thing. It is well known, that we are facing
				    			several socio-economic problems that often leads to economic crisis. To address the economic problem where significant part of it involves
				    			the public service of goods, benefits, subsidies which the governance system constantly performs to address the peoples need for whom, when and

				    			of middle men eating up, people are left with only the remaining of the service promised. There is too much middle men and agent in the supply
				    			chain and thus representatives thought of reducing the distance between the service provider and the service accessor. This can either be done by
				    			systematically uprooting the corruption with political will or by hopefully circumventing the middle man assuming corruption will die in

		  					Basically UID/Aadhaar employs a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics">multi-modal biometric</a> system for uniquely
		  					identifying a person. Like any other measurement and instrumentation chain, it also employs a data acquisition acquisition using sensors,
		  					preprocess it, store it and use it later for any purpose for which the whole system is designed for. With more and more characteristics
		  					measured from the sensors, data dimension increases multi fold which compounds complexity of the system. Like any other measurement it
		  					is inhenrently <b>probabilistic</b> in nature. Thus principles and methods of probability and statistics over the authentication and
		  					identification process play a significant role.
		  				</p>

				    		<p>
				    			Scientifically nobody can deny that there are range of values is the only possible outcome, and it would be unscientific, & denial of truth
				    			if somebody claims that they can identify an individual uniquely with 100% conformance (YES or NO decision). It is just a clear indication
				    			of how much the claimer has addicted to their belief system and throught process. This is where certainly, several biometric data is acquired
				    			from the individuals to profile biologically(biometrics) or using behavior(behaviometrics).

				    		<p>
				    			Using Biometrics for authentication, identification schemes as in UIDAI, naturally requires individuals permission before even attempting to
				    			formally extract the biometric data using various sensors & instruments. The fact, is wherever we go, we spread the same biometric information
				    			while interacting naturally with the environment and socially. Thus there is high probability of somebody extracting the same biometric data,
				    			and use it to cheat the authentication, and identification system - atleast in theory. With todays cracking skills and gadgets it can be

				    			situation and took a non-rational approach to store the private stuff with themselves. This with tresspassed liberty, in addendum creates central
				    			non replaceable dependency and gathers immeasurable power from it. The assumption is beyond the engineering and security principles. UIDAI simply
				    			seems to assume that its security cannot be ever broken.

		  				<h4>Forced Social Gain:</h4>
				    		<p>
							We have to accept that UIDAI, has really innovated from the extreme corporate cultures of digital world,
				    			and dared to bluntly apply to a vast democratic nation - India. Since most of the people are ignorants
				    			<mark>(yes they are intelligent than us, and we are bunch of fools and sheeps).</mark> So far, it cannot

				    			easily. Personally, i see it as a political innovation on how to mobilize themselves by immobilizing the
				    			criticisms and actions against them and their extremist ideologies.
				    		</p>

				    		<p>
							<mark>It seems that only few factors are necessary to push people at such scales</mark>. The people has to be :

				    			<ol>
				    				<li>under <u>constant</u> fear of war, national security threat, terrorism</li>
				    				<li><u>keep them super busy</u> with daily life and stay ignorant about broader things and systems</li>
				    				<li>often mobilize police <u>brutality</u> to show "who is the master around here ?"</li>
				    				<li><u>stop</u> providing rightful and deserved <u>service if people do not comply</u></li>
				    				<li><u>never make them leave once they fall</u> prey for subjugation (trap)</li>
				    			</ol>
				    		</p>

				    		<p>
				    			People accumulated through such dreadful strategy seems to work in country like India. Even when UIDAI/Aadhaar

		    			crisis. I am going to listen and learn from the personalities i know around in the space of Aadhaar and its influence.
		    			This would help me and you to see the points, what people are thinking, why are they thinking so, and what is their
		    			bearing about the issue.

		    		<h3>What is Needed ?</h3>
		    		<p>
		    			Clearly people are angry about both crisis in governance as well as modern threat to their fundamental rights.
		    			They question the purpose of constitution, the purpose of governance in first place. Everybody wants to
		    			solve problem in their <b>own ways and beliefs</b>, where <b>bias and motivational reasoning</b> would be
		    			abundant, which will result in creating vicious cycles of problems rather than democratic solutions. We
		    			have to understand that solution is not goal here, but also <b>the way of the solution</b> proposed,
		    			implemented, executed to cooperatively solve the problem with peoples participation is the actual goal. That
		    			must motivate us, provide the impetus for faith, desire to mobilize, with democratic means without any
		    			coercion and paternal character.
		    		</p>

		    		<p>
		    			Having a technology is not the solution. Technology is intertwined with the society. People getting misused,
		    			either because of their ignorance, does not mean that government can exploit the ignorance to leverage it to
		    			execute its paternal attitude. Furthermore, if technology seems to be provide ultimate solution, why do we need
		    			civil societies, parliamentary deliberations, apex courts, civil participation, consitution ? We have to realize
		    			that technolgoy can be part of the solution. We have to accept it. <b>Believing that technology is the solution
		    			is bit extreme and indicates the ignorance of socio-economic history manking faced till now.</b> Whoever worked
		    			with science and technology will definetely accept that technology is not just what we have in hand, it is
		    			accumulation of practices, innovations, skills, labour, and techniques derived from them.
		    		</p>

		    		<blockquote>
		    			What we need is:<br>

			  			<p>
							We have to realize and accept that despite being a <b>Socialistic</b> economy as stated in the preamble of our
			  				constitution, we are living on a quagmire of market economy characterized by capitalistic and neoliberal
			  				attitudes. With a non-democratic, but market and profit, power focused economy, growth and development are
			  				always flowing towards only a few, which in turn again makes the few rich, and powerful as they already are.
			  				This creates a polarized dichotomy in our national economy.
			  			</p>

		  				<p>
		  					In such a socio-economic machinery, and politics learning towards paternal authoritarian extremes, it is apt to
		  					expect reduction of democracy into totalitarian state with the <mark>loss of moral auhority</mark>. In a
		  					society totally driven and influenced by selfish-interest based economy, that plutocracy, technocracy and all
		  					other feudal characteristics that over powers a few will always mix up that severly reduces people from
		  					citizens to serfs to objects to numbers. This has lead to not only socio-economic crisis but also infrastructural,
		  					governance, & political crisis.
		  				</p>

		  				<p>
		  					Somewhere, along the line we have lost the political appetite and balls to stand up to our collectively declared
		  					constitution, that have initiated socialistic welfare systems like <b>Cooperatives</b>, decentralization and grassroot
		  					community support. Instead of being progressive political parties and government in general are regressive. State
		  					promotes itself into <mark>police state</mark>, <mark>opaque state</mark> and <mark>mass surveillance state</mark> whenever
		  					the chances occur, leveraging on the people's fear, and even instill fear of war, terrorism, national security threat,
		  					etc... This attitude and practice, eventually breaks the checks and balances enshrined by founding fathers of independent
		  					and republic India.

			  			<p>
							Governance in India, as mostly experienced by most of us is mostly opaque, huge, complex management & administration system,
			  				for a common citizen. Citizens cannot openly participate in the transparent governance process. It is authoritative
			  				in structure. Government forming the burecratic and executive organs have stopped being servants of people and instead
			  				assumed itself as powerful master. Such is indicated clearly by the subjugative policies, acts, systems of surveillance
			  				over public communication kept in place, support and acceleration for UIDAI like schemes even in unconstitutional and unethical
			  				way in the name of "greater good". It is always the "greater good" uttered by the oppressive regimes before converting
			  				the democracy into a functional authoritative government that little by little amends the constitution to exercise absolute
			  				power over the people.
			  			</p>

		  				<p>
		  					We do exactly have such governance crisis, where it serves the few but oppresses the common majority of citizens, of middle
		  					class and poor who are actually the yielding grounds for the corporate monopolies, feudalists, plutocrats, technocrats, etc...
		  					Always subsidies are more for bigger and bigger corporates. UIDAI can be illustrated as one best example of how system of
		  					governance shows partiality fueled by political and financial power. UIDAI never have been properly deliberated in parliamentary
		  					houses before it started interacting with other systems. UIDAI has been enforced through Aadhaar act 2016 through a Finance Bill
		  					in a improper way. Our government is so famous for instigating police force as just pawns in the socio-political game between
		  					the people and itself. It has <mark>always been a key in enforcing unjust laws</mark> and thereby modulating the consitution with an
		  					unjust amendment, which would create irreversible repercussions thereafter.
		  				</p>

		  				<p>
		  					It seems, as if that government wants immunity through opaqueness against transparency and accountability which people are exercising
		  					through Right To Information. It enacts subjugative systems like NATGRID, CMS, UIDAI... to make the citizen more transparent in turn
		  					making itself more and more opaque. This is a clear indication of inversal of democracy. Our government and political powers never

				    			When it comes to technology, we know it is a chain of accumulated innovation in skill & labour. Processess have to be
				    			prioritized before rushing to the final stage of the solution, else it will create unnecessary super problems
				    			which compounding the solution into a new nightmare weed that requires further attention. First things first, before attempting
				    			to propose a solution that would apply to massive democratic country like India, one has to clearly think, whether a solution
			  				of such sort is really necessary, what are all the stones in way, and how they have to be solved again in a cooperative
			  				way without exploiting people for profit.

				    		<p>
				    			In the case of Aadhaar, it clearly depends on electric energy, connectivity, internet, identification, authentication.
				    			On a national scale, with problems in distributing electricity, with most of population still digitally divided, with
				    			absence of constitutional overarching privacy and data/information security policy, poor communication infrastructures
				    			with corporate monopoly in constant rise, absence of innovative or alternative technology incentives against centralized
				    			identification, and authentication systems will <mark>eventually create a grave disaster disaster sitution</mark>. Anybody
				    			with common sense, or atleast a few years experience in technology can think about it, such that there are other social,
				    			economical barricades that can be removed in first place without racing based on over confidence in technology. Failure of
				    			a project is bearable, whereas failure of democracy due to half baked and over honoured technology will put lead to modern
				    			totalitarian rule. Such fast forwarding solutions also might bring <mark>irreversible situations.</mark>
				    		</p>

				    		<p>
				    			If a <mark>rational being</mark> is to solve the economic problem pertaining to delivery of public goods, services & benefits
				    			to people, it would have been atleast in the following order:

				    			<ol>
				    				<li><mark>Support</mark> & bring consitutional law securing individuals <u>right to privacy</u> & information confidentiality</li>
				    				<li>Decentralize <mark>Cooperative Renewable Energy generation</mark> Systems</li>
				    				<li>Encourage decentralized <mark>Cooperative Community Communication</mark> infrastructure Networks</li>
				    				<li>Do extensive transparent research on peoples <mark>consumption pattern</mark></li>
				    				<li>Do study non-biometric based identification feasibility study with <u>geo-spatial & cultural diversity</u></li>
				    				<li>Openly create <u>socially auditable technology</u> for people participation in governance</li>
				    				<li>Educate people to <mark>participate in the 100% open development process</mark></li>
				    			</ol>
				    		</p>

				    		<p>
				    			Moreover governments, bureaucrats, politicians must stop <b>over honouring</b> celebrities, business stalwarts,
				    			technology behemoths, corporate luminaries and must start really thinking before handling social responsibilities
				    			over to them, just because they are <i>"successful"</i> in their business. Its common sense, to learn that such
				    			a process is not at all democratic. People elect representatives, but in whose power, representatives can appoint
				    			personalities without ever communicating to people or even without a public deliberation ? This will create a
				    			serious polarized dichotomy in politically, socially and economically.
				    		</p>

				    		<p>
				    			Pertaining to Aadhaar, establishing a privacy law must have been a proper democracy respecting governance action,
				    			instead of <b>"lets exploit and bring order"</b> attitude. Such attitude clearly, indicates that government
				    			expects and coerces people to be completely transparent and making itself more opaque than ever. This is not a
				    			democratic governance but a totalitarian governance in action.
				    		</p>

				    		<p>
				    			Probably for Mr. Nandan M. Nilekani who came from a well established, capitalistic model of doing business &
				    			managing people who work for it, where everything is centralized, hierarchially controlled in a top down
				    			fashion the solution would be realizable in a centralized way only. That would be his view and those who accept
				    			such views may be grouped together as a set of volunteers who look the world in their views. They might be
				    			<b>OK</b> in compromising some of their liberties - as they see it as a barricade in implementing a workable
				    			solution. For others, like me it is a <mark><b>NOT</b> OK</mark>. There are people who would not willing to
				    			sacrifice their liberty and privacy. It is a matter of principle and not pragmatism.
				    		</p>

				    		<p>
				    			People who have been into real science and technology would already have learned about FOSS, FOSH realms,
				    			peer production, alternative economies, decentralization, cryptography, etc... If some how, the Aadhaar team
				    			has not looked into it, then it indicates their ignorance or atleast incompetance in leveraging such frameworks
				    			to create tools pertaining to it for the problem in hand. Perhaps, the following video as an example would
				    			be an example to illustrate : why active participation and economic transaction does not need unique identification ;
				    			does not need centralization in control... etc...

		  					<mark>let the people have control over their information <b>==</b> privacy.</mark> If UIDAI technical team, directors,
		  					chairmans, volunteers and over honoured technocrats cannot see this, which is right before their eyes, they can be declared
		  					intellectually as blind as they are physically. OK, where was i when UIDAI/Aadhaar was introduced and enforced... ?
