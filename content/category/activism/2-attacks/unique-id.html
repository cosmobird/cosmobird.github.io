  	  	<p>Hey there establishment supporters <b>!</b></p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLAIMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The following are <b>my views</b> about the Unique Id. system implemented in India, which is now branded
  	  		as Aadhaar. I still believe, that having and sharing my views and thoughts, is still possible, with liberties
  	  		gauranteed by Indian Constitution, to its law abiding Citizens, which is fundamentally founted from the
  	  		values of freedom, democracy, liberty, equality, secular nature, civil disobedience... Yes, i am legally an
  	  		Indian citizen. But there is no reason to submit my proof of citizenship to anybody who desperately needs it.
  	  		It is my liberty and consent to decide whether to provide it or not. If any establishemnt or government felt
  	  		repulsed by this, executing some dumb actions based on despair, then it would be a best proof, that they
  	  		are the perfect examples of dissent supression, & conservational attitude.
  	  	</p>

		<h3>WHY ? WHY ? WHY ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
			Why am i writing this, when i have other interesting to do ? Basically, i dont like complaining about stuff,
  	  		crying around a problem, without atleast moving a stick or even trying that ! But literally we are in a situation
  	  		where critical thinking and open progressive discussion becoming few and rare. These days common people discussing
  	  		about social, economic, political environment, systems itself is considered as a rebellious attitude by the
  	  		governments and establishments. In India especially, every peaceful protest demonstrated by common people have been
  	  		systematically oppressed, subjugated, hindered since republic. As a result of continuous and cumulative
  	  		thoughts in my mind - sometimes, -- no most of the times -- i ask myself :
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p class="content-blockquote">
  	  		<b><i>
  	  			am i part of this republic nation that ensured liberty in its constitution ?
  	  			<br>
  	  			am i really living in a democratic republic nation ?
  	  			<br>
  	  			does others feel the same way i do ? "
  	  		</i></b>
  	  	</p>

		<h3>WHAT IS IDENTITY ?</h3>
		<p><h4>From NCERT book:</h4></p>
  	  	<p>
			People as a collective entity come into being only through the basic constitution. It is by agreeing to a basic set
  	  		of norms about how one should be governed, and who should be governed that one forms a collective identity.

  	  		<ul>
  	  			<li>
  	  				<p>
	  	  			<b>Political Identity:</b><br>
	  	  				One has many sets of identities that exist prior to a constitution. But by agreeing to certain
	  	  				<u>basic</u> norms and principles one constitutes oneâ€™s basic political identity.
  	  				</p>
  	  			</li>
  	  			<li>
  	  				<p>
  	  				<b>Moral Identity:</b><br>
  	  					Constitutional norms are the overarching framework within which one pursues <u>individual aspirations,
  	  					goals and freedoms</u>. The constitution sets authoritative constraints upon what one may or may not do.
						It defines the fundamental values that we may not trespass. So the constitution also gives one a
  	  					moral identity.
  	  				</p>
  	  			</li>
  	  			<li>
  	  				<p>
  	  				<b>Ethnic Identity:</b><br>
  	  					Indian Consititution, does <u>not</u> make ethnic identity <u>a criterion for Citizenship</u>.
  	  				</p>
  	  			</li>
  	  			<li>
  	  				<p>
  	  				<b>National Identity:</b><br>
  	  					Relationship between different regions of the nation & central government constitutes the
  	  					national identity of the country.
  	  				</p>
  	  			</li>
  	  		</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<div class="accordion">
  		  <div class="accordion-section">
  			<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#citizen"><h3>THE COMMON CITIZEN :</h3></a>
  			<div id="citizen" class="accordion-section-content">
		  	  	<p>
		  	  		When it comes to a citizen - personal identity is instrumental, as being a part of the socio-economic-political sphere.
		  	  		Anyone could have a stand about social, economic, political situation of the society. This stand, could then be
		  	  		expressed with the gauranteed fundamental rights & liberties of the constitution. The expression could take any form,
		  	  		and thus by nature, cannot be refuted until it is made. Every individual has the right to express their political dissent,
		  	  		which collectively plays a key role in the political climate of the society. This is balanced again by the constitutional
		  	  		rights. Liberty cannot exist without empathy.
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		The way of expression, need not be limited through suffrage alone in a democracy. It shall take any form of communication,
		  	  		and contributes progressively as long as the expression stays rational. The degree of rationality can only be asserted with
		  	  		the degree of empathy involved in the communication. With the constitution, in a democracy, every individual citizen has the
		  	  		right to dissent and criticize the establishments, organs of governance like executive, legislation and judiciary. Whenever,
		  	  		a citizen felt the tresspass of their fundamental rights, then the constitutional law would stand for rescue. This inturn,
		  	  		intutively declares that the constitution can only gaurantee fundamental rights, when it is rationally defended by the citizens
		  	  		collectively. Democracy and Liberty has to emerge from people, and <u>it must not be expected</u> from the management team or
		  	  		the state. <mark> Only then it is democracy or else its just list of options. </mark>
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		In the context of identity, especially in democratic society like India along with a Union of India - Republic government,
		  	  		right to privacy is inherent within the right to life. This demands one to properly understand <b><i>WHAT IS PRIVACY ?</i></b>
		  	  		in first place. Simply put, <b>HIDING</b> cannot be equated to <b>PRIVACY</b>. I believe that one can establish their
		  	  		political identity through the currently available <mark>voters ID cards.</mark> Any citizen in India, devoid of their
		  	  		economic status can attain one, and based on the current election model, citizens participates in election. Similarly,
		  	  		basic unit of economy, a family has <mark>ration ID cards.</mark> With these and other derived essential ID schemes in place,
		  	  		the <u>management team</u> (government) can provide the promised services. So far, these identification systems, stayed within
		  	  		the balance & never dared to tresspass the fundamental liberty.
		  	  	</p>
  			</div>

  			<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#management"><h3> THE MANAGEMENT :</h3></a>
  			<div id="management" class="accordion-section-content">
		  	  	<p>
					In simple terms, the governance model in a democratic society can be viewed as management system, that aids for proper
		  	  		functioning of democracy while maintaining itself as a part of the whole. It is very much obvious that any management
		  	  		system no matter to what degree its principles are truthful and sincere. Any institution that does all in its potential
		  	  		to gear towards short term solutions and growth for existing socio-economic problems, might <b>creep in bad practices</b>, which
		  	  		is called <mark>institutional debt</mark>. No institution can empathize each and every one individually and solve the problem
		  	  		from their view point. This necessitates a collective response from the people and then try to solve it with better
		  	  		ideas and concepts, without ever breaching fundamental consitutional principles.
		  	  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  		Now directly and indirectly, people has to pay for this institutional debt - a cost incurred urgence to solve the problem
		  	  		in a short term. As a result this seeds the vicious cycle of debting and costing that keeps the whole system in dead lock
		  	  		without ever reaching a balance at all.
		  	  	</p>
  			</div>
  		  </div>
  		</div>

  	  	<h4>Few logical questions !</h4>
  	  	<p>
  	  		Why should people suffer in first place and pay the toll for the institutional debt, for the problems that arises from and
  	  		present within the institution itself. If a management cannot solve its own problem, then how can people rely on it to solve
  	  		the societie's problem ? Even when the problem is deeply and widely spread in common, no matter how bigger and powerful is
  	  		the solution, it is not worth to implement something that is anti-liberty, or anti-constitutional. If state and people are all
  	  		equal before the law, then the subjugating state, and its anti-constitutional activities has to be restrained.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  		If power of authority is derived from the collective extraction of responsibility from the voted citizens, then how come the
  	  		authority can override its source of power in first place ?
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p class="content-blockquote">
  	    	  	<i>Declaration of Independence</i> : <br>
  	    	  	<b>if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or
  	    	  	to abolish it.</b>
  	    	</p>

		<h3>ACCUMULATION :</h3>
		<p>
	  		Thus no matter how many powerful identification schemes the government tries to establish and push it to people, so that it can
	  		ease its operation and duty the people has the right to dissent it. It has to be remembered, that <b>Unjust Law</b> do exist
	  		and a <u>rational</u> set of people, has the <u>right and duty to associate against such unjust laws and acts</u>. Accumulation of these
			these unjust laws, acts as the subjugative source for the state, which in first place have occured because of irrational,
			unthoughtful, short-term solutions, which erodes and deprives democracy from itself, leaving behind only cold authoritarianism.
	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  		Such conditions serves as the means to do whatever the established institutions, individuals, bureaucrats, plutocrats, technocrats, ...
			wants to do. This will enroll the whole system to a periodic and frequent short-term solutions, crisis and problems that keeps pounding on
  	  		the society itself. This eventually constructs a vicious cycle, which is a a result of ignorance about democracy, absence of -- participation
  	  		in democracy. Management instead of making the society self organizable and self managemeable and dissolve itself later, seems to
  	  		continue in perpetuity. Definetely the current bearing of government is not towards it. <mark> People being reduced from citizens to subjects
			to objects to commodities becomes normative as part and parcel of the effect. </mark>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3> PERSPECTIVE OF IDENTIFICATION :</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  		One has to be aware what identification is, and what is actually not. Furthermore, people needs to know when identification
  	  		is required and who shall initiate the identification in first place. A clarity is necessary to understand the suttle differences,
  	  		which eradicates the misuse of identification systems. Following are the points i learned from identification systems. It is
  	  		always safe and just to look from an individuals perspective when it comes to identification. Technology can be present, but
  	  		not at the expense of individuals liberty and violation of fundamentally gauranteed consitutional principles and directives.

  	  		<ul>
  	  			<li>Id. is not a simple asset or commodity</li>
  	  			<li>Id. Need not be queried & verified from state</li>
  	  			<li>Id. Need to be with the individual</li>
  	  			<li>Id. can only be requested by the state, that too after stating the probable cause</li>
  	  			<li>Id. is an interface between personal and social spheres</li>
  	  			<li>Id. must not enable surveillance</li>
  	  			<li>Id. Technology cannot solve socio-economic problems</li>
  	  			<li>Id. is not a commodity</li>
  	  			<li>Unique Numbering might result in chronic misusage</li>
  	  		</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>So ? ... What's the problem ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  		One shall easily see where unique numbering is usually deployed ? To understand the seriousness of the unique
  	  		identification, one can compare and contrast the existing systems where unique id. has already been in place.
  	  		Around us, we have seen them in the following scenarios :

  	  		<ul>
  	  			<li><h4>In products:</h4>
  	  				<p>
  	  					Mostly we see them in packages, consumer products, devices and machines that one purchases,
  	  					that take ownership on. Any two objects which are highly similar can only be discriminated
  	  					by only using a unique number generated through some means during production, and packaging
  	  					process.
  	  				</p>
  	  			</li>
  	  			<li><h4>In Controlled Parks:</h4>
  	  				<p>
  	  					Other case is that, for wildlife, preservation and monitoring of their population, sancturies &
  	  					national parks usually involve numbering the species to collect data, profile their behavior,
  	  					to understand their interactions with each other, ... etc.
  	  				</p>
  	  			</li>
  	  			<li><h4>In Jails/Prisons:</h4>
					<p>
						Also we know that people in prisons are numbered. This makes it easy for counting, identifying,
						surveilling, and managing as a whole group, that actually reduces the pain of management
						and administration. Rules have definetely eased management and it is possible, because it is in
						the prison.
					</p>
  	  			</li>
  	  			<li><h4>In Emergency Environments:</h4>
  	  				<p>
  	  					People would be numbered in large scale hospitals. Again this would enable the management to
  	  					automate certain process that could help keep the hospitalized (ill) people safe and secure.
  	  					During emergency situations this helps in maintaining the order of the process dictated to
  	  					make sure the system operates without any emotional disturbances.
  	  				</p>
  	  			</li>
  	  			<li><h4>In Examinations:</h4>
  	  				<p>
  	  					When people are examined strictly as a formal process to test them for their talent or anything
  	  					else, usually involves supplying a unique identification number to make sure the test is
  	  					executed without any malpractice. Anybody can be subjected for inspection by squads and examiners
  	  					without the need for consent. Only the authority has the deciding power till the exam duration.
  	  					(this is the case atleast in India).
  	  				</p>
  	  			</li>
  	  		</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  		My argument is not about the pragmatic usage of numbering and unique identification, but about the psychological
  	  		effect that such a scheme would create in the authority or whoever tries to push it. It has to be noted, that unique
  	  		identification so far has only accompanied with technology that provides completely centralized and obscure control
  	  		over the id's. When somebody is numbered and uniquely identified with it, they cease to exist as a human, and reduced
  	  		to just a number in a list. A government enforcing such scheme by advertising and endorsing the embedded pragmatic
  	  		advantage has just reduced itself from benevolent governance to brutal warden.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  		How come the above situation is different from whatever scheme a central authrority provides and promises ? Once can
  	  		easily understand, that some of numbering always comes with neglecting liberty and pushing subjugation. Is it
  	  		not disturbing to treat each others as commodities, and reduce ourselves to let subjugate ourselves. At the end of
  	  		the day, government is run by common people mostly who are already busy with their daily routine to survive and to
  	  		earn a decent monthly wage to feed their families. Does Unique Identification, is that worth to keep it deployed ?
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>UIDAI & AADHAAR :</h3>
  	  	<p>
			Let's talk about UID, & its Aadhaar as rationally as we can. This is not going to be something similar to wikipedia article
  	  		about UID/Aadhaar and those who want to read that could please <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar">go visit and learn</a>.
  	  		I wish to have a unbiased discussion with myself about the issue, and why set of people are polarized, look at their perspectives,
  	  		suggestions and arguments about the system.
