  	  	<p>Hey there <b>!</b></p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLAIMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Honestly this post might feel boredom for those who are not interested about Indian Consitution,
  	  		& Governance -- stuff. These are my writings that reflect my understanding & interpretation on
  	  		what i have & how much i have gone far enough to learn about the constitution of India itself.
  	  	</p>

  		<h3>WHY i am interested ?</h3>
  		<p>
  			For those who ask this question, just think about the environment you live in, just think where
  			do we live ? how we live ? why do we fear state & government in general ? why do we transformed
  			ourselves into beings of consumerism ? why do we always expect somebody else to make a move ?
  			why do we fear police ? why people are beaten & tortuned brutally by them ? why human rights
  			commission have so much complaints lodged against impunity ? why do we constantly chase "money" ?
  			why are we so ignorant about who to contact when we end up with some social problem ? why our
  			representatives cannot function as we intend to ? why no matter what gov. comes to manage governance,
  			there is no improvement in people life & well being ? why we dont yet have free education ? why
  			students attempt suicides in our institutions ? why do farmers die everyday ? why are we silent
  			and keep on going to earn wages, despite all these situations ?

  			<br>
  			<br>

  			<b><i>JUST ASK YOURSELVES !</i></b>

  			<br>
  			<br>

  			We are atleast gauranted to create a thought thread about such questions -- atleast in our mind for now.
  			Even if constitution could not answer all the questions that are brewing in our minds directly, it has
  			considerable relationship and influence with the social, economic, & political environemnts which the
  			society is living on. I am basically interested in deconstructing such relationships, and in the triumph
  			i desire to understand the nature of each sub system as much as i can digest - which keeps me rational,
  			instead of confusing & feeding myself emotionally.

  			<div id="accordion-declaration-of-independence" class="accordion-section-content">
	  			<p>
					We believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom
		  			and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities
		  			of growth. <mark>We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the
		  			people have a further right to alter it or to abolish it.</mark> The British Government in India has not only deprived
		  			the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India
		  			economically, politically, culturally, and spiritually. We believe, therefore, that India must sever the British
		  			connection and attain Purna Swaraj, or complete independence.
		  		</p>

		  		<p>

					India has been ruined economically. The revenue derived from our people is out of all proportion to our income.
		  			Our average income is seven pice (There were 4 pice in an anna, and 16 annas in a rupee) per day, and of the
		  			heavy taxes we pay, 20 per cent are raised from the land revenue derived from the peasantry and 3 per cent from
		  			the salt tax, which falls most heavily on the poor.
		  		</p>

		  		<p>
					Village industries, such as hand-spinning, have been destroyed, leaving the peasantry idle for at least four
		  			months in the year, and dulling their intellect for want of handicrafts, and nothing has been substituted, as
		  			in other countries, for the crafts thus destroyed.
		  		</p>

		  		<p>
					Customs and currency have been so manipulated as to heap further burdens on the peasantry. British manufactured
		  			goods constitute the bulk of our imports. Customs duties betray clear partiality for British manufactures, and
		  			revenue from them is used not to lessen the burden on the masses but for sustaining a highly extravagant
		  			administration. Still more arbitrary has been the manipulation of the exchange ration, which has resulted in
		  			millions being drained away from the country.
		  		</p>

		  		<p>
					Politically, India's status has never been so reduced as under the British regime. No reforms have given real
		  			political power to the people. The tallest of us have to bend before foreign authority. <mark> The rights of free expression
		  			of opinion and free association have been denied to us, and many of our countrymen are compelled to live in exile
		  			abroad and cannot return to their homes.</mark> All administrative talent is killed, and the masses have to be satisfied
		  			with petty village offices and clerkships.
		  		</p>

		  		<p>
					Culturally, the system of education has torn us from our moorings, and our <mark>training has made us hug the very chains
		  			that bind us.</mark> Spiritually, compulsory <mark>disarmament has made us unmanly,</mark> and the presence of an alien army
		  			of occupation, employed with deadly effect to crush in us the spirit of resistance, has made us think that we cannot look
		  			after ourselves or put up a defense against foreign aggression, or even defend our homes and families from attacks of thieves,
		  			robbers, and miscreants.
		  		</p>

		  		<p>
					We hold it to be a crime against man and God to submit any longer to a rule that has caused this fourfold disaster
		  			to our country. We recognize, however, that the most effective way of gaining our freedom is through nonviolence.
		  			We will therefore prepare ourselves by withdrawing, so far as we can, all voluntary association from the British
		  			Government, and will prepare for civil disobedience, including nonpayment of taxes. We are convinced that if we can
		  			but withdraw our voluntary held and stop payment of taxes without doing violence, even under provocation, the end of
		  			this inhuman rule is assured. We therefore hereby solemnly resolve to carry out the Congress instructions issued from
		  			time to time for the purpose of establishing Purna Swaraj.

							A system of government in which the citizens exercise power directly or elect representatives
