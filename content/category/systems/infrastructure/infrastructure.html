  	  	  	great communities who are working for years. Sometimes, might be wrong, and i welcome readers
  	  	  	to correct me wherever possible. I have kind of collated or summarized about what i have learned
  	  	  	till now. Thus it is almost my knowledge mirror about the field or concept - which means the

  	  	<h3>WHAT IS INFRASTRUCTURE ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
			Infrastructure is reality. It is the real stuff which we depend on to live daily. It is the
  	  	  	collective reflection of our survival capability. We humans are basically animals. Are we
  	  	  	social beings ?.. well i dont know yet ! However, we have been changing our infrastructure
  	  	  	by displacing ourselves since our inception, and then we tried to change the infrastructure
  	  	  	using our intellectual curiosity, that led explore and discover stuff to understand a wider
  	  	  	scope, which in turn provide us with information about the required infrastructure for our
  	  	  	survival that can provide us with expected features.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Now for a <b>stable survival</b>, we expect a fundamanetal infrastructure which is deterministically
  	  	  	stronger and immune to disruptive changes. To start we designed the architectures that are necessary
  	  	  	to build thes infrastructures that we expect. Thus infrastructure is now the implementation of
  	  	  	the architecture where our expectations are embedded in its design. right ?
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	What will happen, if the infrastructure is experiencing a massing hit emerging internally or
  	  	  	externally , that overwhelms its threshold of pain, and loses control ? The following options
  	  	  	can be observed from history :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>instead of responding, it might react to the disruption (distress due to fear)</li>
  	  	  	  <li>would defend itself or oppress the disruption/change in extreme</li>
  	  	  	  <li>some times responds, and progressively adapts to fit itself for change</li>
  	  	  	  <li>some times defeated by uprise, and a new system of infrastructure raises, with altenative architectures </li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
			What will happen if the infrastructure, abstracts more and more, to a state where the fundamanetal
  	  	  	architecture is not obviously transparent. One cannot refute, it is not transparent, but at the same
  	  	  	time cannot comprehend its presence & meaning hindered by the complexities of infrastructure. Then
  	  	  	there might be a chance that the infrastructure and the features built on top of its platform could
  	  	  	use such difficult/loophole to gain which it values as profit. Infrastructure by default derives
  	  	  	its power from the people who constructed it and who lives in it. All the platforms built on top of
  	  	  	it were again to serve the people in it. With people depending upon the infrastructure, and growing
  	  	  	ignorant about its complex orchestration, lose the default transparency and accountability from the
  	  	  	erected infrastructure.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>IS IT NECESSARY ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Survival strategies, Design, Architecture, Organization, & Infrastructure are all part of the process.
  	  	  	One could not isolate just one of them and discuss about it alone. We live our lives on the infrastructures
  	  	  	which are obvious but, some would only recognize only after mentioning it. For instance :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>Time ( think about it )</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Food Production & Distribution</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Communications</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Transport & Logistics</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Governance</li>
  	  	  	  <li>....</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	No matter how much abstract we could go about infrastructures, end of the day they all depend upon the
  	  	  	Physical resources. It is with the technology in hand we transport all these resources available in the
  	  	  	environment and transform into inputs and outputs of several infrastructures & some times we make
  	  	  	infrastructures using them.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Transforming resources into supplies is hard work and we do it, because the method has proved to provide
  	  	  	us with stable survival strategy. This has recursively enabled us, to save more time that let us think
  	  	  	and contemplate our curiosities without any fear of survival. Thus with more and more free time, feautres,
  	  	  	services we yield from the current infrastructure, we tend to do it indefinetely by erecting loops &
  	  	  	treadmills that does and maintains this cycle constantly. We <b>want</b> it to be constant. Thus one part
  	  	  	of the people in the society would naturally be subjugated, deprived liberty, emotionally motivated to serve
  	  	  	this purpose, so that the remaining part would follow their curiosity. With growing population, everyone wants
  	  	  	to migrate to the interesting side of the offer, which is regulated using competition, prerequisite & qualitification
  	  	  	strategies.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>WHAT'S THE PROBLEM ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Well, the people who constructs the infrastructure using some basic design of architecture, tend to end up
  	  	  	bifurcated or multifurcated, just to serve back the infrastructure itself. Now, the terrible question is, whether
  	  	  	these humans end up serving the infrastructure or the other way round which was originally envisoned ? While it
  	  	  	is not fair to divide and privelege people by themselves to enjoy the fruits while the remaining toil !.
  	  	  	Moreover, with time, our dependency on these centralized structures become more and more intimate and tight,
  	  	  	to a point where distinction between the structure and the people is no more recognizable.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	All these conditions are emergent, and originally it might never be intended to reach a state like this at all.
  	  	  	This situation provides us with the following three options :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>flow with the system's infrastructures</li>
  	  	  	  <li>stop & think of tinkering & fixing it through updates</li>
  	  	  	  <li>think of alternative designs, architectures proposing a new structure</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>HOW ITS MADE ?</h3>
  	 	<p>
  	 	  	Every system is derived from network of systems embedded in the architectural design. These infrastructures
  	 	  	are then constructed for several necessities, which are again netwoked to form a super infrastructure
  	 	  	that depends upon these smaller infrastructure. Thus to keep these systems away from disturbances, it
  	 	  	infuses defensive or oppressive loops in the design itself, which will later fight against those disturbances.
  	 	  	Learning from the past, will help mitigate the known and measured disturbances, and designers will have
  	 	  	to design by predicting all possible future disruptions that might occur. This makes the infrastructure live.
  	 	  	It is no more a system of machines, run by deterministic machines, which can be programmed to execute
  	 	  	according to conditions, rather it becomes a sentinel, that can react, respond, defend, or even oppress &
  	 	  	attack when it sees fit and necessary.
