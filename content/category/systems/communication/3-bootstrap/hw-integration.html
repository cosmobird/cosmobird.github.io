  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLIAMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	I have shared the information from my subjective experience. I would not like to take responsibility
  	  		for you have done anything crazy and dumb on your side when attempting to do the stuff i have listed here.
  	  		Furthermore, i always break things and change stuff, which means, i would constantly keep this post
  	  		updated, and thus following exactly as here might be a bit hard. On the other hand, i will not restrict
  	  		you to try this at your home, after all it is in your discretion. <i>Happy Hacking</i> !
  	  	</p>

  		<h3>TO START:</h3>
  		<p>
  			Based on my previous learnings and my peers recommendations from the community network groups, i have
  			iterated the layout of the required design that would satisfy my need through several iterations. For now
  			i have settled in organizing a hierarchical network setup that help easily organize and manage my
  			local area network which my devices are connected together, that runs required services & functionalities
  			which i aspire to host my self. For this instance this blog/website itself. As covered in the <a href="../2-node-hack/hw.html">devices</a>
  			post, a lot of stuff has to be considered before even making a hackable device. If the <u>community</u> has a
  			set of <u>open designs</u> for the devices used, then it would be wise and economic to use the <u>locally made</u>
  			device, than importing a "open supportive" <mark>(non proprietary/non-tivo)</mark> device.
  		</p>

  		<h3>WHAT I HAVE ?</h3>
  		<p>
  			Let me start with what devices i have in hand. Eventhough, i have fascinating ideas for network setup
  			that would only mean a imagination rather than reality that can atleast produce a functional action. Devices
  			are not immaterial and thus consumes power for its programmed operation. The current power infrastructure
  			in my home is being used to power all these devices, which is a Uninterruptable Power Supply system built
  			for home appliances, as a power backup during electric grid power outage. As depicted in the
  			<a href="../2-node-hack/pwr.html">power infrastructure</a>, and from the following table i could approximately
  			get a <b>power budget</b> that would be consumed by the communication infrastructure. Later when the power
  			system is updated with a renewable energy source this data and calculation would be of remarkable use to
  			calculate the necessary power devices to be made or procured to integrate and update the power infrastructure
  			itself.

  			<table class="content-table">
			  <thead class="content-table-head">
				  <tr>
				    <th>Appliance</th>
				    <th>Purpose</th>
				    <th>Usage/Power</th>
				  </tr>
			  </thead>
			  <tbody class="content-table-body">
				  <tr>
				    <td>Software <br>Controlled <br>Radio</td>
				    <td>Amateur Radio</td>
				    <td><10%/5W</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>ADSL Modem</td>
				    <td>Internet</td>
				    <td>100%/5W</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>Wifi Router</td>
				    <td>Local Network</td>
				    <td>100%/5W</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>BeagleBone <br>Black</td>
				    <td>Hosting</td>
				    <td>100%/5W</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>PC/Laptop</td>
				    <td>Hosting</td>
				    <td>100%/60W</td>
				  </tr>
				  <tr>
				    <td>PC/Laptop</td>
				    <td>Personal Use</td>
				    <td><50%/60W</td>
				  </tr>
			  </tbody>
			</table>

			One must not forget about the connecting medium that enables <b>linking</b> between different types of
			devices, with proper interfaces. Now, common sense, says that the current technology available in wireless
			medium using proper antennas and radio, (economic & open) are not equivalent in performance when comapared
			with the wired medium. Thus in general, i have tried to reduce the usage of wireless mediums when trying
			to connect devices in the hierarchical structure. Both cost & performance are better than the wireless
			medium - unless wireless interface is inbuilt in the devices itself. Ethernet cables with RJ45 ports,
			coaxial cables with suitable connectors, will be required to properly connect antennas with the radio
			modules in wireless devices. Since visions of community networks have planned with wireless mediums, to
			enable less clutter, and more connectivity with the neighbouring peers, atleast one device would be
			required to represent it as the <b>community node</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			With the power supply in place which is compatible with the calculated power budget, can now be connected
			together to form a local area network. The network architecture - i.e, the topology can be decided by the
			organizer of the network. As said, i would like to implement a hierarchical topology which is very much
			the pattern of the existing internet. This structure would enable me to establish a easily scalable network
			within the home, and at the same time serve as a <b>transitional base</b> to make my device and services to
			be a part of community network.
