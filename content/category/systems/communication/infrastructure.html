  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Some of you might find it strage and even anti-establishment, while the reality
  	  	  	being - they are the one that we mostly depend on, atleast for now. I write this
  	  	  	with a hope of igniting alternative thought process which might inturn inspire
  	  	  	one to question about the current status of communication systems infrastructure.
  	  	</p>

		  Communication need not be a commodity, need not be a resource for profitability, but it is a necessity !
		</p>

  	  	<h3>WHAT IS COMMUNICATION ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
			A phenomena that enables us to share resources, information, opinion, suggestion, content, with each other
  	  	  	when we think we want to with very minimal effort and inertia. Every human civilization, have encountered
  	  	  	problems in communication, and many have found a method that suit their needs. Communication is not just a
  	  	  	system, but it is a Complex Networked system.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Fundamentally, Communication is an abstract term that help us denote the phenomenon of information sharing.
  	  	  	Thus the number of participants in the communication is just one part of the phenomena. The concept of
  	  	  	communication is not going to change in general whether it is just 2 friends discussing criticially about
  	  	  	an issue in the local park or it is a parliamentary deliberation making laws and amending consititution, or
  	  	  	it can be a written letter, tele-fax, tele-phone conversation, broadcasting, amateur radio participation,
  	  	  	internet messaging, emailing, etc.... When information is exchanged between the participants based on an
  	  	  	agreed rules/protocols then communication is happening.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li><h4>Communication helps us express our intentions</h4></li>
  	  	  	  <li><h4>Communication is the first form of democratic participation</h4></li>
  	  	  	  <li><h4>Communication provides us the medium for expression & participation</h4></li>
  	  	  	  <li><h4>Communication is reinforced by technology that constantly adapts to change</h4></li>
  	  	  	  <li><h4>Communication is based on information and in turn it influences information exchange</h4></li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>WHAT'S THE NETWORK THING ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Communication always depends and adapts to technological change. It is one of the foremost scientific & engineering
  	  	  	discipline that encourages radical innovations. From Cave drawings to Internet, this has been the driving force
  	  	  	behind our curiosity to explore whether every form of technology to be used a communication tool or not. Languages
  	  	  	are the base rock of communication. It determines the rules/protocols, & our thought process too ! Apart from that
  	  	  	communication is a networked system made up of many sub systems that are usually connected with proper interfaces
  	  	  	to provide mediums, & tools.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The Network is the <b>underlying physical infrastructure</b>, that forms the basis to implement the mechanisms &
  	  	  	policies, that we use as the platform to communicate. And <b>abstract Networks</b> can also be formed upon the communication
  	  	  	services. In other words, Physical connections form the Internet (network of networks), and above that we have emerged
  	  	  	a <b>web</b> layer that helped us think about innovative ways to share resources and information with each other
  	  	  	more or less in a flat fashion. Atleast, that is how the inception of Internet envisoned it to be.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Construction of physical infrastructure, provides the necessary <b>connections</b> that are required to enable
  	  	  	and establish a reliable communication. These connections and their topology form the fabric of Netowrk itself.
  	  	  	Abstract networks that are formed on top of web, undergo a lot of innovation and thus lot of changes are adapted
  	  	  	as soon as as they are made. Delay between creating a communication tool and using it is reducing to infinitesimal
  	  	  	value day by day, because of the nature of collaborative authorship of projects. There is always some social mass
  	  	  	associated with such projects which adopt earlier to it and further propagate its usage in web.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Such, innovation to usage collaboration is not technically easier to undergo in the physical infrastructure of the
  	  	  	internet. The infrastructure is so rigid, such that it supports the rapidly varying flexibile social networks
  	  	  	residing on top of the internet whose fundamental behavior rooted in the design of the physical infrastructures
  	  	  	connection and topology. Thus when a change is required in the infrastructure, we face with the following problems:

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>Social Mobilization</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Changing current infrastructure is not economic</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Services tied with it cannot abruptly modify its design without affecting users</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3><b>A bit of History :</b> COMMONS <b>+</b> COMMUNICATIONS & INTERNET obviously <b>:)</b></h3>
  	  	<p>
			Every innovation and change in the realm of communciation and communication networks were mostly contributed by the
  	  	  	commons. Furthermore, commons are the information generators and the information aggreagators, information absorbers,
  	  	  	which provide the impetus to create new technologies and tools that enable to share the information among others in
  	  	  	a easy and economic way. Internet is one great such collaborative effort such that its completeness is always greater
  	  	  	than the sum of its constituents. It evolves continuously and in turn influences people to create change. It is one
  	  	  	large <b>entropy field</b>. All that is enabled by the availability of fundamental physical connection infrastructure.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Learning about the history of communication systems is itself a separate fielf of study, where the drive for expression,
  	  	  	has made us innovate newer and newer forms of language, which in turn reinforced the drive to innovate newer forms
  	  	  	of communication methods constantly over time, along with our non-linear behavior, which in turn influed the history
  	  	  	of technology itself. Communication systems and the infrastructures always have been one single common fabric which
  	  	  	we humans have always stood upon. I think the following video might help you observe, how it is intertwined & evolved
  	  	  	along with us :

			Many wonder why the hell the current internet structure looks so familiar with the biological networks like brain's
  	  	  	neural architecture, fungus, etc... Furthermore, who invented internet at first place. The fact is <b>no one !</b>.
  	  	  	That made it eligible to be a single most marvellous common's land and infrastructure, where nobody have any monopoly

  	  	  	Commons create modern day cave paintings and express as comics, with its own grammar and awesomeness. Artists, create
  	  	  	their content and share it in Web from which they gain more social following than ever marketing industry could offer.
  	  	  	Commons are the one maintaining the following properties of Internet to this day :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>Equality through information Neutrality → <b>net neutrality</b></li>
  	  	  	  <li>Freedom of expression</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Sharing</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Reliable & Durable Communication</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	If you have read my <a href="../../../../content/category/systems/infrastructure/infrastructure.html">article on infrastructure</a>
  	  	  	then it might be possible to understand the significance of infrastructures from both individual and social perspective.
  	  	  	When the commons own the infrastructure, through collaborative contribution, the system seems to emerge itself organically
  	  	  	and stabilizes itself through flexible adaptive process and grow further that extends the network. It is this very
  	  	  	idea that influenenced commons to adapt similar set of principles to apply to maintain the natural resources as a cultural
  	  	  	infrastructure, rather than a synthetic industrial resource. But such commons contribution seems to be relatively lacking
  	  	  	in influencing the underlying physical infrastructure, because of technical limitations and absence of proper economic
  	  	  	incentives. This provide a great symbiotic relationship with the system, to deliberate on the principles, engineer new technical
  	  	  	proposals, observe transparency & neutrality, create tools and technology very effectively.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Major powers in the real world merely reduced to just a webpage, among billions of websites out there, and further could not
  	  	  	able to effectively use <b>consent manufacturing</b> strategy as a weapon against democratic action when people roar with
  	  	  	criticisms and pressures to invoke change in the real world. This at least in principle eradicates <b>power asymmetry</b>.
  	  	</p>

  	  	</figure>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Even with current structure of internet, we could see massive people uprise and non-violent protests, which have proved its
  	  	  	effectiveness, through online campaigns signing & emailing; access to potential information & proves which cannot be denied;
  	  	  	sharing of critical information for awareness, propagating discussions, video conversations, humours, memes, which actually
  	  	  	takes control of the public opinion of those who are all connected to the internet via its one of its web platforms - even
  	  	  	when centralized. With constant raise in public opinion, soon the state has to respond - (party driven by social & political
  	  	  	pressure) to meet what the people need with critical deliberation.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>A STORY FOR YOU <b>:)</b></h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Epiphany striked for DAS, who studies social engineering and have decided to start a social networking company in
  	  	  	India, where anybody can join and do the similar stuff all other current day centralized social networks offer. It is
  	  	  	not a new idea, but its tailor made cool UI and features specific for students, artists, researchers, homemakers,
  	  	  	elders, ... were added in order to spend more time in it. DAS knows that such a system requires loooooooot of data
  	  	  	and it cannot be demanded, he has to streamline his internal action plan as follows :

  	  	  	<ol>
  	  	  	  <li><b>Bootstrap:</b>
  	  	  	    <ol>
  	  	  		  <li>Find a rich & dumb funder</li>
	  	  	  	  <li>Create a gorgeous website</li>
	  	  	  	  <li>Popularize it with early adopters</li>
  	  	  	    </ol>
  	  	  	  </li>
  	  	  	  <li><b>Gain Social momentum:</b>
  	  	  	    <ol>
	  	  	  	  <li>Provide freebies to attract more</li>
	  	  	  	  <li>Track the number of user registration</li>
  	  	  	    </ol>
  	  	  	  </li>
  	  	  	  <li><b>Scale along:</b>
  	  	  	    <ol>
  	  	  	  	<li>Migrate to techology stack</li>
  	  	  	  	<li>Log users information [ more information <b>→</b> better service ]
  	  	  	  	<li>Provide better security for servers</li>
  	  	  	  	</li>
  	  		    </ol>
  	  	  	  </li>
  	  	  	  <li><b>Learn & Capitalize:</b></li>
  	  	  	    <ol>
  	  	  	      	  <li>Analyze, and learn from information</li>
  	  	  	      	  <li>Extract connections</li>
  	  	  	      	  <li>Provide better targeted service</li>
  	  	  	      	  <li>Gain social capital</li>
  	  	  	      	  <li>Transform gain to financial & economic capital</li>
  	  	  	    </ol>
  	  	  	</ol>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/illustrations/comms-communication/story.png" alt="DAS's story">
  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>fig.2.</i> DAS's plan </b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	DAS decides to practice/emulate this action plan to observe how it might go even with a smaller/feeble user
  	  	  	base. One fine day in his hostel dormitory, decided to test this, using his own laptop, local network as the
  	  	  	initial resource. He convinced his friends to join the network. Everything is free of cost. His service coverage
  	  	  	reached his department students within few days, and people started to converse through the service, which
  	  	  	rapidly gained momentum and made the resources halt because of their technical limitations.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	DAS decides to convince some of his geeky friends in all other departments, to share the service instance, so
  	  	  	that the load can now be distributed. After a week or so, the influx of students, professors, and others
  	  	  	access for the service seems to be overwhelming. Now, DAS raises the demand to fund him, in order to scale up
  	  	  	the service. People who find it most attractive become the initial funders, and with that he could run the
  	  	  	service better with better hardware stack, for instance more storage and memory.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The no. of users seems not to stop, and nowhere drops. With increase in the rate of registration - filled by
  	  	  	new incoming students to the university and substantial no. of users after finishing their degrees are still
  	  	  	connected. This pushes DAS to further increase the capacity by demanding more capital funding to raise the
  	  	  	resource by orders of magnitude.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li><b>→ Revelation 1:</b>
  	  	  	    <p>
  	  	  	    	Here the problem simply seems to reduce to : <br>
  	  	  		[ better scalablity <b>→</b> (with) <b>→</b> powerful tech. resource <b>→</b> (comes) <b>→</b> more cost ].
				<br>
				<br>
  	  	  		DAS soon realized that there is a potential loooooopy going on here and its pattern can be deduced earlier
  	  	  		and thus can be solved by projecting the trajectory making the service virtually endless, with constant
  	  	  		update of technological resources & technology itself that suits centralized services.
  	  	  	    </p>
  	  	  	  </li>
  	  	  	  <li><b>→ Revelation 2:</b>
  	  	  	    <p>
				Logging meta information of service, as well as users will help improve the service for better & moreover
  	  	  	      	projects the service as some form of endless resource to the user - that can potentially drive them to
  	  	  	      	log their personal datas, files, resources for better reliability and backup. Furthermore, some users
  	  	  	      	might use the resources provided by the service as the facilitator for his/her requirement. Thus, providing
  	  	  	      	reliable service or abstracting by simulating reliability by obscuring hard and dirty jobs behind the user
  	  	  	      	interface of the service will tie them to the service.
  	  	  	    </p>

  	  	  	    <p>
  	  	  	      	This mechanism, always increases the <b>social capital capacity</b> influx & the mechanism is only regulated by the
  	  	  	      	policy guidelines which itself could be changed at any point of time as the owner - DAS sees it fit !
  	  	  	    </p>
  	  	  	  </li>
  	  	  	  <li><b>→ Revelation 3:</b>
  	  	  	    <p>
  	  	  	    	When a conflict occurs between the users or between the user and the authority whom DAS has signed a contract/
  	  	  	      	agreement, that abides the constitution and governance of the university, the final decision and action completely
  	  	  	      	depends upon the DAS's discretion. Whooooooooooa ! complete control. Why ? with so much social capital derived
  	  	  	      	from the users through complete psychological dependency, any authority would not even try to restrict the growth
  	  	  	      	of the service. Furthermore, when the service is completely run by the capital invested by the users, DAS, would
  	  	  	      	have to just go check the policy, which everybody agreed and take so and so action ! <b>remember:</b> the policy
  	  	  	      	itself, can be changed with time as per owner/investors/funders wish.
  	  	  	    </p>
  	  	  	  </li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>WHAT'S THE PROBLEM ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Eventhough internet, has emerged out of commons contribution, the very nature of it has not provided mechanisms to restrict
  	  	  	the influx of systems, infrastructures & services that are already flawed in the real world. In fact, they are the ones that
  	  	  	inspired people to think alternatively and create internet in the first place. With such diverse mix, internet was at some
  	  	  	point of time has been recognized as potential space for business and commerce apart from free souls, hipsters, hackers
  	  	  	wandering around writing and hosting their websites, experimenting it with to learn networking, computing sciences. By this
  	  	  	time still penetration of internet is not much deeper than it is today. With more and more percolation, accelerated by the
  	  	  	academic research, and business spaces, world wide web has become a real space for gaining social capital that really
  	  	  	engaged online business systems. This has made internet very popular and allowed several governments to embrace internet, to
  	  	  	provide the necessary fundamental infrastructure to their countries.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	With ever growing social base, Web, became the fertile ground for centralized ecosystems to enable the users of internet with
  	  	  	information services, with which data/information became the new commodity for e-commerce & e-business systems. This continues
  	  	  	still today ! Even we commons find that collaboration seems to much easier when it happens in a commonly addressable location.
  	  	  	Yeah !. Today almost all human collaboration projects are mostly central in functionality if not in topology and architecture.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	There are two problems i see, to be potentially addressed :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>Lack of experimentation by commons over the infrastructure</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Lack of clarity in understanding Centralization & Hierarchy</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	With almost all real world services, which can be represented using information have been now mobilized towards web based
  	  	  	technology that runs over internet using centralized infrasturctures that connect to the underlying physical topology of the
  	  	  	internet itself. Furthermore, Initial technical challenges has led topology of internet to be hierarchical and establish
  	  	  	them through cables (still most % of internet is still based on guided medium). Thus the above listed two problems can be
  	  	  	seen as a emergent situation based of the following:

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>Technological challenges in Physical networking</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Huge belief in Centralized business models</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>fig.3.</i> Problems that underlie the lack of understanding and experimentation</b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  	  	<h3>DIVE DEEP !</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	To understand how centralization and hierarchy usage does deeply affect the commons thought process, one has to understand
  	  	  	both its advantages and limitations. The current internet structure is lot skewed from its intended trajectory. But the
  	  	  	current structure also teaches us how not a network be synthesized. In other words, internet is filled with synthesized
  	  	  	fabric, instead of symbiotic emergent topologies. The establishment of e-business, e-commerce, online payment & banking
  	  	  	systems have reinforced the significance of centralization and hierarchy and has already reached people more than ever along
  	  	  	with internet.

	  	  	<ul>
	  	  	  <li><b>→ Centralization:</b>
	  	  	    <p>
	  	  	      	It is the effect that we experience through the services and problems we face with it. Centralization in
	  	  	      	topology is so popular because of its control ability that allows administration and management tasks to be completed
	  	  	      	with ease. The problem is internet as envisoned by the commons is actually against licensing, administration and so on...
	  	  	      	With centralization, addressing & regulation becomes easier which made the services built with it under a single point
	  	  	      	of administration.
	  	  	    </p>
	  	  	    <p>
	  	  	      	However, presently, most of the services once popular undergo a series of decentralization process - but only in
	  	  	      	functionality. This does not make the whole infrastructure decentralized or federated. No control is provided to the
	  	  	      	user. Still the same <b>Server & Client</b> communication is handled. All that the current structure does is to shift
	  	  	      	their servers to locations to improve localized service, redundancy, backup strength, better service rechability etc...
	  	  	    </p>
	  	  	  </li>
	  	  	  <li><b>→ Hierarchy:</b>
	  	  	    <p>
				Hierarchy is a fundamental mathematical structure that helped us to organize information and memory. It is so basic
	  	  	      	that without such interpretation of classification & grouping of information, knowledge organization would become
	  	  	      	so hard to manage. Usually centralized architectures, and thus the infrastructures following it use the hierarchical
	  	  	      	management strategy, because of its efficiency. When the services becomes large <b>scalability</b> is a vital issue
	  	  	      	which is so far solved with hierarchy and centralization.
	  	  	    </p>
	  	  	  </li>
	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The draw backs are :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>Central point of failure</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Circumvents, grassroots independency</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Usually non-transparent in its operation</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Causes power & responsibility asymmetry</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Produces unnecessary accountability loads</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Economy is reduced to trickled down fashion</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Cost involved to erect and maintain is so large</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Surplus of resources are used as marketing parameter</li>
  	  	  	  <li>User potentially seen as the data acquisition instrument</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Usually competition oriented instead of cooperation oriented</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Centralized policy changes might be different from initial settings</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Always indefinetely demands more and more resources to provide scaling</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Creates a isolation between user and service - compromising transparency</li>
  	  	  	  <li>With more centralization, power and responsibility is loaded to a central point</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Prone to attack from crackers, as it represents honey pot of information density</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Loops of information dependency, freebies, social density - hinders decision making</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Inability to check the mechanism of service even if the policy emphasizes transparency</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p class="content-blockquote">
		  <b>power</b> <b>→</b> (demands) <b>→</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>→</b> (demands) <b>→</b> <b>accountability</b>
  	  	  <b>→</b> (demands) <b>→</b> <b>control</b> <br>
		  thus, one can see the situation as : <b>{ power</b> <b>→</b> (demands) <b>→</b> <b>control }</b>
		</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	One can view the centralization and hierarchy in the light of the following parameters :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li><h4>Architectural topology</h4>  &nbsp - &nbsp topology by design</li>
  	  	  	  <li><h4>Network topology</h4> &nbsp - &nbsp topology by connections</li>
  	  	  	  <li><h4>Functional topology</h4> &nbsp - &nbsp topology by operations, functions</li>
  	  	  	  <li><h4>Informational topology</h4> &nbsp - &nbsp topology by information routing</li>
  	  	  	</ul>

  	  	  	Technical reconstruction of the infrastructure in one or two of these forms, never transforms the centralized power.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>( PUBLIC FUNDED ) != ( COMMONS OWNED )</h3>
  	  	<p>
			In conventional governance, there are institutions which are centralized but are funded by the public where the
  	  	  	institution is funded by the people through the governance structure (via legislature and bureaucracy). When
  	  	  	the institution is answerable to the people, the channels of communication are laid by protocols and rules
  	  	  	which actually does not fit todays expctation and often feel so dumb, even when there are proper reasons behind
  	  	  	it. Here the infrastructures are governed by the state. Usually public funding happens through state funding and
  	  	  	by taxes imposed on people, right ?
  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>fig.4.</i> Who owns in "public funding", what participation does people have ?</b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	With commons, the approach is more symbiotic, where the owner ship is not based on funding alone, but through
  	  	  	cooperative and participatory actions like contribution, design, implementation, documentaiton & management in a
  	  	  	collaborative way. This provides a common platform where nobody can own anything in particular apart from their part of
  	  	  	their contribution. Thus the interdependency to implement something for practical usage demands collaboration,
  	  	  	where <b>peer produced</b> ideas, products are brought together and collaboratively connected to setup a ecosystem,
  	  	  	through which the economy emerges. However, this requires large social density to get started and the communities
  	  	  	usually struggles until the participation reaches a <b>inflection point</b>. Most of the cultures seems to have used
  	  	  	this approach as a reliable sustainable model. Economic ecosystems derived based on such cultures seems to self sustain
  	  	  	than the current centralized models.

		  <b>remember :</b> for every social & democratic uprise and action, communication is vital. If we let communication in the
		  hands of a few, then we are literally handing over our freedom & liberty to a few, who have systems that can only churn profits
		  and comfort out of it. If we do that, we are going to be the best ever slaves in the history !
