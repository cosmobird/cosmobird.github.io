  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLAIMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	This is not a complete tutorial on how to setup a software stack to
  	  	  	serve communication. All i have listed here is my set of ideas, possibly
  	  	  	learning from my peers, myself while trying to achieve a self reliable
  	  	  	and self hostable communication infrastructure. The contents might change
  	  	  	based on my learning in future.
  	  	</p>

		<h3>WHY ?</h3>
	  	<p>
			Logic requires abstraction and phenomenal functional simultaneously. With the required hardware i.e, devices
	  		and instruments in place, respective system software stack and application software stack has to be deployed
	  		that enables the devices to function for what they are integrated in the first place. Having a software that
	  		just works is <b>under specified</b> for a system to function properly. How the logic is executed by it, how
	  		it is written, who has created it, why it is created, what kind of peer review is done before building for
	  		execution are required to be transparent for those who use and contribute back to the development. Thus only
	  		a software stack that has both accountability & transparency in its construction can only be claimed as
	  		<b>correctly specified.</b>
	  	</p>

  		<p>
  			Every software will have a functional error or logic error or syntaxical error, etc... which might go unnoticed,
  			irrelevant to the type of software we use or how it is used. Thus worrying about errors in the logical
  			and functional implementation is not of primary importance, and is always solved effectively with transparency.
  			The stack which we require for communication here requires real-time performance, with negligible
