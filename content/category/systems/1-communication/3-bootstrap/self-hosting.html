  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLIAMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Its not my fault, if u follow similar steps and stuff is not working for you. All i have here,
  	  		is according to my personal desires and plans. I mean this might not fit you at all specifically,
  	  		but in general might be helpful when u desire to host essential services right yourself in your
  	  		home itself with whatever hardware resources u have. <i>Happy Hacking !</i>
  	  	</p>

  		<h3>WHAT IS SELF-HOSTING ?</h3>
  		<p>
  			Present communication networks depends heavily on information routing strategies compiled from
  			innovative and efficient ideas manifested as protocols and logical stacks. A service comprises
  			functionality of both hardware and software. The underlying physical infrastructure of the device
  			providing the required service is facilitated by the hardware - which we can call as a <mark><b>N</b>ode
  			<b>C</b>omputer.</mark> Software that defines the logic required for the service runs on this
  			physical infrastructure. This constructs a virtual world of computing which has defined boundaries.
  			Within this construct individual's communication and content organization has to be met without
  			compromising much on performance and if possible power & storage. Thus a service depends on following
  			parameters:

  			<ol>
	  			<li>Storage Consumption</li>
	  			<li>Processing & Memory requirement</li>
	  			<li>Power Consumption</li>
  				<li>Ease of Deployment</li>
  				<li>Usability of Service</li>
  				<li>Organizing Mechanism & Policy</li>
	  		</ol>
  		</p>
	</div>

<!-- TRYING TO REASON FOR WHY SELF HOSTING IS NECESSARY -->
  	<div class="chapter-header"><span>WHY SELF-HOST ?</span></div>
	<div class="content">
		<p>
  			From a individual's perspective communicating with other peers requires content generation, organization
  			and sharing platforms. These platforms are realized by the services. When these services are self hostable
  			in one's spare desktop computer or laptop, then the individual is essentially becoming "independent" of
  			typical centralized services. But being independent of those services also mean disconnecting from a lot of
  			peers and friends who are already deeply hooked up to "free of money" services. This demands a social
  			change which is essentially a change in thought process that would drive them to tryout self hosting and
  			peer to peer, community communications networking infrastructures.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			There is a significant amount of people who are already trying this out contacting them for help and hanging
  			out becomes the first step in the process. This can be handled in civil clubs, communities, societies as an
  			organized means of community effort to motivate the peers to switch from centralized services to self hosted,
  			decentralized services. This transition happens by enlightening the peers about positive things that are
  			possible and guiding them what they have compromised with existing central services. This not only makes them
  			mobilize them towards a open, decentralized, shared self hosting strategy, but also immobilizes the penetration
  			of centralized services slowly and steadily.
  		</p>

		<h4>Networked Independency:</h4>
		<p>
  			After getting a social mass (a peer set of people), say in a community with the help of available free software
  			stacks it becomes relatively easier day by day to instantiate services that can be deployed at individual level.
			This makes the individual to use their personal computers as a instrument of content generation, organization,
  			communication in addition to simple productive and entertainment usage. This makes communication and information
  			as part of digital culture.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			On the other hand, we know that self hosting also means, one is centrally dependent upon individual level and
  			actually gravitates the individual to monitor & maintain the service to reduce down times and centre point of
  			failures. This is where again the community comes in place. Since every individual knows that individually
  			they are isolated and becomes points of failure, and thus innovative community communication network needs to be
  			setup through which they can share the instances of the services and content, which merely gets copied and rerun
  			in other nodes. Thus sharing emerges from independency and network. This is an emergence that founts out of need
  			and is a complex phenomenon. Such a network is more organic.
  		</p>

  		<h4>Decentralization:</h4>
  		<p>
  			Eradicating centralized control, filtering, dependency has already gained momentum. Communities are making much
  			effort in developing Peer to Peer tools, technologies, frameworks, software stacks that essentially make the user
  			as independent as possible from the grip of big businesses and governments. This can be achieved by attacking the
  			centralization problem in two ways simultaneously :

  			<ol>
  				<li>Changing the fundamental network architecture</li>
  				<li>Changing the web architecture</li>
  			</ol>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Self hosting actually addresses the second part of the solution. By self hosting the required services using
  			simple wall wart devices or spare computers will not change the fundamental hierarchical addressing way of internet.
  			But it addresses the problem in the web layer. Even though data packets goes through the conventional network
  			topology mostly governed by ISP's, Government filter agencies, Telecom Corporations - that enable the actual routing
  			of information between peers, selfhosting essentially makes the user independent of the services which they rely on.
  			But it offers a good entry point to establish community communication infrastructure. It offers a good platform to
  			test and run newer protocols that help the network immune to intrusion and exploitation.
  		</p>

<!-- TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE COMMONALITIES, SPECIFICITIES IN GENERIC MANNER OF HOW I DID -->
  	<div class="chapter-header"><span>HOW TO SELF-HOST ?</span></div>

  	<div class="content">
		<p>
  			Once it is decided to be independent of typical centralized services provided in exchange of personal data and
  			information to some governments and big business conglomerates - one has to come up with a list of services
  			that they are already dependent upon. This list helps book keeping and organizing the service platforms. These
  			services can be monitoried that enables the individual to switch them on or off depending upon their reqruirement.

  	  		<figcaption>Listing required services and Bucketing them into respective host</figcaption>
		</figure>

  		<p>
  			I will focus on what are my desired list of services that i like to host myself in my spare laptop, and see if i
  			can comeup with basic explanation that help manage myself and collaborative help i could get from my peers who have
  			similar interests. Depending upon the requirement and availability of open service stacks, several possible similar
  			integrations are possible. The community have also take into account of common requirements that are fundamental
  			for reliable addressing, identification, and access.
