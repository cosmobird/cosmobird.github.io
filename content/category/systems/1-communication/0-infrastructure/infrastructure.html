	      Every innovation and change in the realm of communciation and communication networks were mostly contributed by the
	      commons. Furthermore, commons are the information generators and the information aggreagators, information absorbers,
	      which provide the impetus to create new technologies and tools that enable to share the information among others in
	      a easy and economic way. Internet is one great such collaborative effort such that its completeness is always greater
	      than the sum of its constituents. It evolves continuously and in turn influences people to create change. It is one
	      large <b>entropy field</b>. All that is enabled by the availability of fundamental physical connection infrastructure.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Learning about the history of communication systems is itself a separate fielf of study, where the drive for expression,
	      has made us innovate newer and newer forms of language, which in turn reinforced the drive to innovate newer forms
	      of communication methods constantly over time, along with our non-linear behavior, which in turn influed the history
	      of technology itself. Communication systems and the infrastructures always have been one single common fabric which
	      we humans have always stood upon. I think the following video might help you observe, how it is intertwined & evolved
	      along with us :

	      Commons create modern day cave paintings and express as comics, with its own grammar and awesomeness. Artists, create
	      their content and share it in Web from which they gain more social following than ever marketing industry could offer.
	      Commons are the one maintaining the following properties of Internet to this day :

	      <ul>
		<li>Equality through information Neutrality â†’ <b>net neutrality</b></li>
		<li>Freedom of expression</li>
		<li>Sharing</li>
		<li>Reliable & Durable Communication</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      If you have read my <a href="../../../../../content/category/systems/0-infrastructure/infrastructure.html">post on infrastructure</a>
	      then it might be possible to understand the significance of infrastructures from both individual and social perspective.
	      When the commons own the infrastructure, through collaborative contribution, the system seems to emerge itself organically
	      and stabilizes itself through flexible adaptive process and grow further that extends the network. It is this very
	      idea that influenenced commons to adapt similar set of principles to apply to maintain the natural resources as a cultural
	      infrastructure, rather than a synthetic industrial resource. But such commons contribution seems to be relatively lacking
	      in influencing the underlying physical infrastructure, because of technical limitations and absence of proper economic
	      incentives. This provide a great symbiotic relationship with the system, to deliberate on the principles, engineer new technical
	      proposals, observe transparency & neutrality, create tools and technology very effectively.

	      Major powers in the real world merely reduced to just a webpage, among billions of websites out there, and further could not
	      able to effectively use <b>consent manufacturing</b> strategy as a weapon against democratic action when people roar with
	      criticisms and pressures to invoke change in the real world. This at least in principle eradicates <b>power asymmetry</b>.

	      Even with current structure of internet, we could see massive people uprise and non-violent protests, which have proved its
	      effectiveness, through online campaigns signing & emailing; access to potential information & proves which cannot be denied;
	      sharing of critical information for awareness, propagating discussions, video conversations, humours, memes, which actually
	      takes control of the public opinion of those who are all connected to the internet via its one of its web platforms - even
	      when centralized. With constant raise in public opinion, soon the state has to respond - (party driven by social & political
	      pressure) to meet what the people need with critical deliberation.

	    <h3>WHAT IS COMMUNICATION ?</h3>
	    <p>
	      A phenomena that enables us to share resources, information, opinion, suggestion, content, with each other
	      when we think we want to with very minimal effort and inertia. Every human civilization, have encountered
	      problems in communication, and many have found a method that suit their needs. Communication is not just a
	      system, but it is a Complex Networked system.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Fundamentally, Communication is an abstract term that help us denote the phenomenon of information sharing.
	      Thus the number of participants in the communication is just one part of the phenomena. The concept of
	      communication is not going to change in general whether it is just 2 friends discussing criticially about
	      an issue in the local park or it is a parliamentary deliberation making laws and amending consititution, or
	      it can be a written letter, tele-fax, tele-phone conversation, broadcasting, amateur radio participation,
	      internet messaging, emailing, etc.... When information is exchanged between the participants based on an
	      agreed rules/protocols then communication is happening.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      <ul>
		<li><h4>Communication helps us express our intentions</h4></li>
		<li><h4>Communication is the first form of democratic participation</h4></li>
		<li><h4>Communication provides us the medium for expression & participation</h4></li>
		<li><h4>Communication is reinforced by technology that constantly adapts to change</h4></li>
		<li><h4>Communication is based on information and in turn it influences information exchange</h4></li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>

	    <h3>WHAT'S THE NETWORK THING ?</h3>
	    <p>
	      Communication always depends and adapts to technological change. It is one of the foremost scientific & engineering
	      discipline that encourages radical innovations. From Cave drawings to Internet, this has been the driving force
	      behind our curiosity to explore whether every form of technology to be used a communication tool or not. Languages
	      are the base rock of communication. It determines the rules/protocols, & our thought process too ! Apart from that
	      communication is a networked system made up of many sub systems that are usually connected with proper interfaces
	      to provide mediums, & tools.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      The Network is the <b>underlying physical infrastructure</b>, that forms the basis to implement the mechanisms &
	      policies, that we use as the platform to communicate. And <b>abstract Networks</b> can also be formed upon the communication
	      services. In other words, Physical connections form the Internet (network of networks), and above that we have emerged
	      a <b>web</b> layer that helped us think about innovative ways to share resources and information with each other
	      more or less in a flat fashion. Atleast, that is how the inception of Internet envisoned it to be.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Construction of physical infrastructure, provides the necessary <b>connections</b> that are required to enable
	      and establish a reliable communication. These connections and their topology form the fabric of Netowrk itself.
	      Abstract networks that are formed on top of web, undergo a lot of innovation and thus lot of changes are adapted
	      as soon as as they are made. Delay between creating a communication tool and using it is reducing to infinitesimal
	      value day by day, because of the nature of collaborative authorship of projects. There is always some social mass
	      associated with such projects which adopt earlier to it and further propagate its usage in web.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      Such, innovation to usage collaboration is not technically easier to undergo in the physical infrastructure of the
	      internet. The infrastructure is so rigid, such that it supports the rapidly varying flexibile social networks
	      residing on top of the internet whose fundamental behavior rooted in the design of the physical infrastructures
	      connection and topology. Thus when a change is required in the infrastructure, we face with the following problems:

	      <ul>
		<li>Social Mobilization</li>
		<li>Changing current infrastructure is not economic</li>
		<li>Services tied with it cannot abruptly modify its design without affecting users</li>
	      </ul>

	      Epiphany striked for DAS, who studies social engineering and have decided to start a social networking company in
	      India, where anybody can join and do the similar stuff all other current day centralized social networks offer. It is
	      not a new idea, but its tailor made cool UI and features specific for students, artists, researchers, homemakers,
	      elders, ... were added in order to spend more time in it. DAS knows that such a system requires loooooooot of data
	      and it cannot be demanded, he has to streamline his internal action plan as follows :

	      <ol>
		<li><b>Bootstrap:</b>
		  <ol>

	      <img src="../../../../../content/resource/illustrations/comms-communication/story.png" alt="DAS's story">
	      <figcaption>DAS's plan </figcaption>
	    </figure>

	    <p>
	      DAS decides to practice/emulate this action plan to observe how it might go even with a smaller/feeble user
	      base. One fine day in his hostel dormitory, decided to test this, using his own laptop, local network as the
	      initial resource. He convinced his friends to join the network. Everything is free of money. His service coverage
	      reached his department students within few days, and people started to converse through the service, which
	      rapidly gained momentum and made the resources halt because of their technical limitations.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      DAS decides to convince some of his geeky friends in all other departments, to share the service instance, so
	      that the load can now be distributed. After a week or so, the influx of students, professors, and others
	      access for the service seems to be overwhelming. Now, DAS raises the demand to fund him, in order to scale up
	      the service. People who find it most attractive become the initial funders, and with that he could run the
	      service better with better hardware stack, for instance more storage and memory.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      The no. of users seems not to stop, and nowhere drops. With increase in the rate of registration - filled by
	      new incoming students to the university and substantial no. of users after finishing their degrees are still
	      connected. This pushes DAS to further increase the capacity by demanding more capital funding to raise the
	      resource by orders of magnitude.

		  </p>

		  <p>
		    DAS soon realized that there is a potential loooooopy thing going on here and its pattern can be deduced earlier
		    and thus can be solved by projecting the trajectory making the service virtually endless, with constant
		    update of technological resources & technology itself that suits centralized services.

		    might use the resources provided by the service as the facilitator for his/her requirement. Thus, providing
		    reliable service or abstracting by simulating reliability by obscuring hard and dirty jobs behind the user
		    interface of the service will tie them to the service.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    This mechanism, always increases the <b>social capital capacity</b> influx & the mechanism is only regulated by the

		    from the users through complete psychological dependency, any authority would not even try to restrict the growth
		    of the service. Furthermore, when the service is completely run by the capital invested by the users, DAS, would
		    have to just go check the policy, which everybody agreed and take so and so action ! <b>remember:</b> the policy

	  <!-- THE PROBLEM -->
	  <section id="section-topline-2">
	    <p>
	      Eventhough internet, has emerged out of commons contribution, the very nature of it has not provided mechanisms to restrict
	      the influx of systems, infrastructures & services that are already flawed in the real world. In fact, they are the ones that
	      inspired people to think alternatively and create internet in the first place. With such diverse mix, internet was at some
	      point of time has been recognized as potential space for business and commerce apart from free souls, hipsters, hackers
	      wandering around writing and hosting their websites, experimenting it with to learn networking, computing sciences. By this
	      time still penetration of internet is not much deeper than it is today. With more and more percolation, accelerated by the
	      academic research, and business spaces, world wide web has become a real space for gaining social capital that really
	      engaged online business systems. This has made internet very popular and allowed several governments to embrace internet, to
	      provide the necessary fundamental infrastructure to their countries.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      With ever growing social base, Web, became the fertile ground for centralized ecosystems to enable the users of internet with
	      information services, with which data/information became the new commodity for e-commerce & e-business systems. This continues
	      still today ! Even we commons find that collaboration seems to much easier when it happens in a commonly addressable location.
	      Yeah !. Today almost all human collaboration projects are mostly central in functionality if not in topology and architecture.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      There are two problems i see, to be potentially addressed :

	      <ul>
		<li>Lack of experimentation by commons over the infrastructure</li>
		<li>Lack of clarity in understanding Centralization & Hierarchy</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      With almost all real world services, which can be represented using information have been now mobilized towards web based
	      technology that runs over internet using centralized infrasturctures that connect to the underlying physical topology of the
	      internet itself. Furthermore, Initial technical challenges has led topology of internet to be hierarchical and establish
	      them through cables (still most % of internet is still based on guided medium). Thus the above listed two problems can be
	      seen as a emergent situation based of the following:

	      <ul>
		<li>Technological challenges in Physical networking</li>

	      To understand how centralization and hierarchy usage does deeply affect the commons thought process, one has to understand
	      both its advantages and limitations. The current internet structure is lot skewed from its intended trajectory. But the
	      current structure also teaches us how not a network be synthesized. In other words, internet is filled with synthesized
	      fabric, instead of symbiotic emergent topologies. The establishment of e-business, e-commerce, online payment & banking
	      systems have reinforced the significance of centralization and hierarchy and has already reached people more than ever along
	      with internet.

		<div id="centralization" class="accordion-section-content">
		  <p>
		    It is the effect that we experience through the services and problems we face with it. Centralization in
		    topology is so popular because of its control ability that allows administration and management tasks to be completed
		    with ease. The problem is internet as envisoned by the commons is actually against licensing, administration, centralized
		    control, filtering, surveillance, and so on... With centralization, identification & control becomes easier which made
		    the services built with it under a single point of administration.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    However, presently, most of the services once popular undergo a series of decentralization process - <mark>but only for
		    redundancy & cooking reliability.</mark> This does not make the whole infrastructure decentralized or federated. No control
		    is provided to the user. Still the same <b>Server & Client</b> communication is handled. All that the current structure does
		    is to shift their servers to locations to improve localized service, redundancy, backup strength, better service rechability
		    etc... This ensures the continued ease of maintenance and administration while giving control to the establishment that
		    constructs the infrastructure. <u>Decentralization for better service, presence, competing for social capital, conquering minds
		    through emotional ads & providing attractive reliable service - does not mean dissolving centralized depdnency & authority.</u>

		  </blockquote>

		  <p>
		    At best we could only see decentralization as a transition strategy, to shift to a new way of organized society.
		    Centralization at the top level or at the bottom level, leave us with only with establishment of hierarchy of power
		    and control over others. Ultimately Centralization will go hand in hand with Hierarchy for those who desires to line
		    their pockets with profits and power - all in good intention of course.
		  </p>

		  <h4>Mutates Intention & Ends with Irreversible Complications</h4>
		  <p>
		    Every business and entrepreneurship intention need not be profit motive, and when there are ones that can care about other
		    stuff that matters instead on profit alone - good intentions seems not enough for desired social progression. Most of the
		    present day Information based business empires that rely heavily on Communication Networks, Internet, & Web will promulgate
		    some sort of good intention out of their centralization effort. But it is a well known fact, that good intentions alone
		    shall not take to the place we desired to go. How we attain the goal is also a much more vital factor. Reaching the goal
		    somehow through any means possible are the characteristics of desperate lunatics and has a indirect sociopath behavior. Such
		    desires and business and economic structures constructed out of it have to mutate people to stay ignorant, to not dissent,
		    to just follow, to trust and believe in somebody, etc. Such systems also does not have a socio-economic transition plan that
		    is democratic. All the transition they bring in the name of <b>disruption</b>, is a preambulating tactic with peoples as
		    honest begging consumers in it. But all that is for reaching the "rational, wonderful, greater good intention".
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    Thinking abount it one can see, it not only subjugates people in variety of forms, but also pressures the centralization
		    authority to ask consent from every individual whenever a request or task associated with the individual subscribed to the
		    system is queried. This adds burden to the authority to keep track of consent as proof of communication. This cascades the
		    necessity to further crave for centrally controlled identification & tracking systems. Centralization for access through
		    transfer of responsibility manifests as power, involves transfer of liberty too. Such actions most of the times end up with
		    irreversible complications and socio-economic injustices which human history has a good track record. Ends with universal
		    sufferage but begins with good intentions, & we know it struggled to attain that good intention. What a waste.

		<div id="hierarchy" class="accordion-section-content">
		  <p>
		    Hierarchy is a informational & mathematical structure that helped us to organize information and memory. It is so basic
		    that without such interpretation of classification & grouping of information, knowledge organization would become
		    so hard to manage. Usually centralized architectures, and thus the infrastructures following it use the hierarchical
		    management strategy, because of its efficiency. When the services becomes large <b>scalability</b> is a vital issue
		    which is so far solved with hierarchy and centralization.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    So, hierarchy can be seen wherever we try to classify things for clarity and to study about the behavior of a phenomenon.
		    Its purpose best suits for that. But when we have inequality and <mark>with all good intentions</mark> to end it by utilizing all
		    liberal systems have resulted only in seriously limited solutions - if at all they work in relaity. It comes to a position
		    where solutions that have hierarchical implementation that creeped inherent differences as layers of job/duty in an organization,
		    solicited by labour skill working together to solve a social problem -- are ending up with only scratching their backs
		    by attaining only a moral satisfaction without ever solving the problem in reality. One shall have a satisfaction that they
		    have done something towards addressing the problem which gaurds them from future criticism. A hierarchical model which inherently
		    follows hierarchical power and communication relations, manifestation of non-cooperative principles, will not able to understand
		    the problem in first place.

		    Using Hierarchy only where, why & when necessary, seriously need to be relearned in society. It is important because when

		  <p>
		    When business systems that religiously followed the centralized, hierarchical models with primary motive of profit
		    started visualizing internet as a medium of business transaction and market place to exchange commodities, the real
		    utility of internet started undergoing a change that encouraged other business to shift their operations that dealt
		    with information process bind with internet. This is not only economic, but also help spread the business further
		    forming a near ideal situation for market competition.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    By late 1990's and 2000's innovation of information technology and the availability of ever expanding fundamental
		    global network infrastructure through under sea optical fibre cables, satellites, microwave stations,... business
		    investment ascended with rich venture capital fueled startups that started providing services which essentially
		    depends on the information from their clients. Since these startups were keen in making products and services that
		    connect them directly to the public, a huge spike in their revenue model is witnessed.

		  <p>
		    This model has essentially supplied people with <mark>lost cost or almost free of money</mark> services, social
		    networks, communication gadgets, etc. To make the services more reliable technically more data and information
		    processing power is required. To collect data, the consumer has to be persuaded or mandated softly to supply the
		    data required to the service infrastructure. Most of the time these services are of closed nature, and nobody had
		    the slightest idea of how they do of what they do. The problem in simple terms could be understood by interpreting
		    the above diagram. The business incentives cries to actually construct centralized hierarchical companies and
		    startups with :
		  </p>

		  <ul>
		    <li>Huge Computational Infrastructure </li>
		    <li>Utilizing Internet to communicate with the <mark>information appliances</mark> (gadgets like smart phones)</li>
		    <li>Deploy applications that enables user only to interact with the service</li>
		    <li>Deploy systems and applications that constantly use consumers as targeted advertisment consumers</li>
		    <li>Seperate the consumers from the service as much as possible</li>
		  </ul>

		  <p>
		    This essentially made people <mark>Online Savvy</mark>, that established a normative climate of commodity fetishism
		    in Internet. This further created repurcussions in real economy, as marketing campaigns persuades people to use
		    internet for everything they would imagine of. As users, we welcome new technology and here we like to keep our
		    devices in close proximity, while really we are bifurcated from the actual application that we depdent very much on,
		    where the distance <mark>"a"</mark> <u>keep on shrinking</u>, <mark>"b"</mark> <u>expanding ever</u>. This contradictional deployment
		    of applications that one hand ties itself up closely with the user through innovative User Internation design, while
		    on the whole dependent upon the centralized services - becomes useless without communication - internet. This climate
		    has obscured the actual <mark>huge cost of information logistics</mark>, that comes with this. It costs :

		    We could have so far atleast got the idea of how bifurcation of gadgets from the services have lead to a
		    internet that is hard handled to fill it with such business models - ending up in homogeneity of structures
		    that again precedents as "successful" business models and formulas. This might end up creeping internet more
		    of a market place for business ventures than as a <mark>mutual sharing platform</mark> for the commons. The
		    internet as communication infrastructure and with its web of network, has the potential to emerge as platform
		    of social stage - which again is hindered and impeded by the rise of centralized social networking services
		    like facebook, google, twitter...

		  </figure>

		  <p>
		    People who is mostly ignorant about internt and web, has already been suffering from several compromises.
		    We have already become so much dependent upon these centralized services, for a number of reasons:
		  </p>

		  <ul>
		    <li>ease of usage and interaction (actually addictive)</li>
		    <li>single entry point</li>
		    <li>belief in 24x7 assured availability</li>
		    <li>belief in service accountability</li>
		    <li>ignorance of terms of services & its dynamic</li>
		    <li>ignorance of compromises in informational privacy</li>
		    <li>psychological training of ignoring advertisements</li>
		    <li>once networked in a group, social desire resists to leave the centralized platform</li>
		    <li>believing that alternative approaches are not easy to use without even trying it</li>
		  </ul>

		  <p>
		    The way this dependecy as illustrated in the above digram is pretty interesting. The business models that
		    emerge with such mechanisms always ends up in expanding the degree of dependency for both the consumers
		    and the business people itself. It is both advantageous for both of them at the same time detrimental
		    to both of them beyond measurement. Both the consumers and service providers become highly dependent on
		    each other for their profit motives. This dependency fuels the <b>Data/Information Market Economy</b> <mark>[DIME]</mark>
		    that makes data as valuable as Oil. Since data here represents the data generated from the consumers, it is
		    going to be continuously available for eternity as long as one can get a gadget acting as a <mark>data

		    All present day Inforamtion Appliances - like smart phones, smart watches, smart inner wears, smart x, smart y, etc..

		    reliable. We want to believe that it is reliable because the infrastructure is huge and complex. When one is

		  <p>
		    This illustration shows how the present business models help perpetuate the dependency which ultimately ends
		    much profitable for them. It is remarkable to interpret how this mechanism works atleast in theory. Since the
		    models mostly works in digital and informational realm, it will most likely work as it would work in a idealized
		    situation. The Users <mark>"U",</mark> when come to know about an application, then would provide the data
		    back to the service, and spread the information to the social network group. Some of the group members, might
		    able to try it and become users of the application again, in turn will supply the data back to the service and
		    would recommend the application to other social network group with they are part of. This information diffusion
		    repeatedly reinforces the market transaction of data and more popularization of product, without necessitating
		    any financial complexities that might have demanded huge marketing campaign.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    As <mark>Subscription</mark> becomes richer and richer with information diffusion, the importance of <mark>Sales</mark>
		    of <mark>IA</mark> becomes accelerated in market. Since advertisement have become targeted with the gadgets, and information
		    spreads through the centralized social networks which the business is in control of, people are actually playing with their
		    shoes, their ball, their stick, in their field, with their rules. It always ends profitable to them. The only profit
		    we would enjoy is mental satisfaction, group addiction while we spending for ISP cost, private Information, Data
		    required for computation.

	      There is one prescription to the overarching problems of communication infrastructure. Yet one can see that encouraging and educating about
	      social emergence of communication networks in general along with internet will help people realize the importance of individual participation
	      and peer to peer collaboration. We are already aware of many alternative socio-economic systems that provide theoretical and pragmatic
	      ideas to help construct platforms which can save and even help communities to self sustain through which commons infrastructure can be
	      constructed collaboratively. Information technology and Software communities kindled by the philosophy of Free Software Philosophies, and its
	      adaptation to other fields wherever information is becoming vital for a open, transparent, and collaborative platforms rather than a highly

	      As shown in this illustration one can atleast able to see, that peer production help change the means of production. Individuals no more
	      use computers as just computing platforms but as instruments that potentially could create constructive changes. As computing is
	      becoming more and more democratized and usable the underpinning information processing, programming software logics also do become democratized
	      which comes to commons readily that allows modification, propagation and sharing that was not possible earlier. Surrounding such
	      technological ecosystem, recent decades see a sensitive change in the innovation of alternative economic systems that help people to
	      concentrate more on what they are passionate about, relieving them from conventional job cycles. This makes them more productive
	      socially.

	    <p>
	      With commons based peer production, sharing of designs, logics, procedures, (things can be encoded as digital data) sharing itself
	      is now percieved at a new level and scale. We now have the possibility of constructing healthier social platforms that can able to
	      cooperate with other present economic systems. The Open systems and Peer production climate is one of the best example how social
	      emergence in domain will be copied, customized and adapted to other domain. Such emergency is not limited to information technology
	      alone and it has far more fields than ever imagined. This is a perfect situation where information and network help each other in a
	      symbiotic way rather than a perpetuating way.
