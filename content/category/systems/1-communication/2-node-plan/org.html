  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Hi there ! after reading the previous two posts on communication infrastructure, & social audit, its
  	  	  	influence on driving the fundamental questions about the way we connected, which might either make
  	  	  	you feel bored or helped u think further, i believe, that this & following posts will discuss about
  	  	  	the Design, Organization, Architectural, Practicality aspects of <b>C</b>ommons <b>C</b>ommunication
  	  		<b>I</b>nfrastructure. Contents are subject to update.
  	  	</p>

	<!-- THROUGH THE BASICS ! -->
  	<div class="chapter-header"><span>THROUGH THE BASICS !</span></div>

  	<div class="content">
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Every communication infrastructure requires an architectural organization, in order to
  	  	  	understand how the systems are connected together, based on their requirement & purpose,
  	  	  	with other subsystems or submodules. This architectural layout simply illustrates the
  	  	  	interfacing between the subsystems. Orchestration of this architecture results in a
  	  	  	implementable system having a <b>degree of modularity</b>. To achieve flexibility in the
  	  	  	system design, modularity is essential.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
			Thus before opening the doors of excursion towards a life style for self reliable and self
  	  	  	hosted peer prodused emergent Internet, it is wise to know how & why the modules are orchestrated
  	  	  	based on requirements & expected flexibility. This necessitates one, to understand the
  	  	  	basic operations of a Communication System in general Technical terms. I believe a short discourse
  	  	  	would provide the required lexicon that will guide your further in interpreting the integration of
  	  	  	systems for communication.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>COMMUNICATION: Agents & Mediums</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Any communication infrastructure will atleast require two parties and a common medium connected
  	  	  	between the two. The pre-requisite is that the two parties could understand each other languages
  	  	  	or speak the same language or create a new language to facilitate their communication wisely. Thus
  	  	  	the three conditions are :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>atleast 2 parties ( parties >= 2)</li>
  	  	  	  <li>common medium</li>
  	  	  	  <li>common language</li>
  	  	  	</ul>

  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Let us consider a simplistic model of real world situation, two persons talking with each other...
  	  	  	Keeping the parties & language as a known constant, they could converse using the following mediums :

			<figure>

	  	  	  	<figcaption>Simplistic Communication view</figcaption>
	  	  	</figure>

  	  	  	<ol>
  	  	  	  <li><h4>Script based information + intelligent carrier + physical transportation</h4>
				<p>
					Intentions are represented though the scripts defined by the chosen & agreed language
				  	of communication. The parties involved communicate with each other by employing a
				  	intelligent & loyal carrier or either semi-intelligent carrier to transfer information
				  	to and fro. Thus the scripts are the information which will be interpreted back as
				  	original intentions of the sender by the reciever. Usually humans or any other animals
				  	trained to carry the information is the communication medium here. Thus the reliability
				  	of communication completely depends upon the the medium employed.
				</p>

	  	  		</figure>
  	  	  	    	<p>
  	  	  	    	  	What are all the parameters that influence the selection of communication medium ?

  	  	  	    	  	<ul>
  	  	  	    	  	  <li>Spatial Distance</li>
  	  	  	    	  	  <li>Secrecy</li>
  	  	  	    	  	  <li>Life support</li>
  	  	  	    	  	</ul>
  	  	  	    	</p>
  	  	  	    	<p>
  	  	  	    	  	Here the link between the parties, always refreshed by the frequency of transportation
  	  	  	    	  	executed by the intelligent carrier. Thus the carrier (human or bird or animals) used for
  	  	  	    	  	for transportation establishes the link which in turn is interpreted as the medium of
  	  	  	    	  	communication.
  	  	  	    	</p>
  	  	  	  </li>
  	  	  	  <li><h4>Electrical information + electromagnetic carrier + link layout</h4>
				<p>
					With the discovery of electromagnetics, radio, and formation of electromagnetic field
				  	theory, advancements in semiconducting electronics, information theory : created massive
				  	disruption in the way we communicate with each other. Communication needs no more
				  	intervention of humans or birds - instead replaced with systems which can continuously
				  	be operated to enable communication.
				</p>
  	  	  	    	<p>
  	  	  	    	  	Suddenly everybody can afford to own a communication channel, and whoever subscribes to
  	  	  	    	  	lease a communication channel, can readily converse with the other using some unique
  	  	  	    	  	identification. This seeded the social & private communication media. In the realm of mass
  	  	  	    	  	communication, similar technology was adapted using broadcasting mechanisms which merrily
  	  	  	    	  	accelerate propaganda and speeches of leaders to reach the masses within blink of an eye.
  	  	  	    	</p>

  	  	  	    	<p>
  	  	  	    	  	People are no more seperated by Spatial Distance. Electromagnetic field & affordable Electronics
  	  	  	    	  	virtually eradicated the distance. With rapid changes in mechanized communication systems,
  	  	  	    	  	every human in the loop repeating stuff are replaced by ever increasing electronic/information
  	  	  	    	  	machines/appliances which decreases the supply of life support mechanisms & policies in the infrastructure.
  	  	  	    		We now have a paradigm shift in mode of communication. Instead of deploying a physical carrier, we
  	  	  	    		harness the natural energy - electromagnetic field as the common medium. Suddenly, we now recognize
  	  	  	    		communication links that are invisible and replace transport which was once the primary medium of
  	  	  	    		communication. And these links humanly organized and aggregated together to form <b>communication networks.</b>

  	    	  	With more & more marketing of communication appliances, it gained social mass,
  	    	  	which further raised the pressure on improving technologies that could scale with the
  	    	  	density of subscription. This created a <b>perpetual loop</b> between the technology & social
  	    	  	gravity. Moreover we are experiencing a sea change in making every machine communicable to
  	    		bring some degree of intelligence through online services. This comes with huge cost.

  	  	</ol>

  	  	<p>
			Providing centralized services and marketing them with huge financial support - makes people think that such complex
  	  		infrastructure could not be instantiated locally and scaling with people participation becomes much more hard. It
  	  		has already becoming normative that being connected and dependent on some centralized service free of cost is the
  	  		smart decision one could take. It is considered radical to go independent, self hosted and disconnected from only
  	  		those centralized services that trade and brokerage information.

  	  	  	Transitioning from a centralized communication infrastructure towards a alternate emergent

  	    	<h3>Independence Supportive Systems</h3>
  	    	<p>
  	    	  	Ideally, independence is a mere hope, that helps us to be creative in ideas. Afterall, the societies we live
  	    	  	in have interdependence on each other through sharing. We need systems, that :

  	    	  	<ul>
  	    	  	  <li>help us to be productive</li>
  	    	  	  <li>increases civic participation</li>
  	    	  	  <li>does not subvert journalism</li>
  	    	  	  <li>does not subjugate our liberty</li>
  	    	  	  <li>help increase equlity & empathy</li>
  	    	  	  <li>does not allow centralized control</li>
  	    	  	  <li>helps us to be critically progressive</li>
  	    	  	  <li>help form networks as part of culture</li>
  	    	  	  <li>help us practice civil liberties & duties</li>
  	    	  	  <li>empower us to have a lean government</li>
  	    	  	  <li>does not make us gears of consumerism</li>
  	    	  	  <li>help us regulate information over loading</li>
  	    	  	  <li>empower us to eliminate social & economic issues</li>
  	    	  	  <li>... and other dreams <b>:)</b></li>
  	    	  	</ul>
  	    	</p>

  	    	<h3>What is needed ?</h3>
  	    	<p>
  	    	  	Modules that enable us to travel the transition are key ingridients in cooking a commons communication
  	    	  	infrastructure. These modules have already been designed and shared based on commons based peer production
  	    	  	principles. However, its adaptation is required more than ever. Current infrastructure have only provided
  	    	  	us with consumer appliances that merely makes us easy to generate and consume content. In short, the
  	    	  	gadgets that sit around us are mere <b>information appliances</b>, & communication is just seemed as
  	    	  	part of the information brokering process.

		  	    	  	one announce about their services, blogs, websites, social participation, etc.. ? What will happen if so many
		  	    	  	tries to access the self hosted services, beyond a threshold level - beyond which the hardware resources needs
		  	    	  	to be upgraded & expanded.

		  	    	  	Thus communities has to build infrastructure, protocols, services, applications, with the following properties
		  	    	  	in their thought process. One cannot deny that the open source development model has already addressing them
		  	    	  	properly. Such open strategy have helped communities to create projects that are lean, mean, infrastructure
		  	    	  	independent, democratic, transparent, secured, hackable, .... among other really beneficial usecase factors.
		  	    	  	Here the complexity involved in bring the stability, flexibility, portability are not hidden, but transparently
		  	    	  	shared between anyone who is interested to care to look at.
		  	    	</p>

		  	    	<p>
		  	    	  	On the other hand, proprietary - conventionally closed, centralized systems limited by their business models
		  	    	  	and policies tend to close their development methods & practices, nobody out of that infrastructure do not know
		  	    	  	how the resources are managed, expanded based on user requirements. Such practice have created a perpetuating
		  	    	  	resource hungry system that <b>pushes</b> technological frontier synthetically while at the same time taming
		  	    	  	the users to imagine that the system can supply overwhelming, if not not a indefinite resource with "best
		  	    	  	stability & reliability".

		  	    	  	To enable individual creativity and help each individual network locally, necessary infrastructure has to be provided
		  	    	  	for each community and to each individual when possible. By adapting the same principle, it is necessary to view
		  	    	  	communication in such light. When communication is commons driven, will help form communities, cross-pollinate with
		  	    	  	other communities instead of chasing after reckless business models. Participation will be effective, when confusion
		  	    	  	is less & rationality is more. Rationality necessitates critical thinking, civic participation in governance, policy
		  	    	  	research, etc.. Such research again depends upon knowing the <b>ground truth</b> information in field. The current
		  	    	  	structure of internet, mostly does have lot of <b>pseudo-scientific</b>, <b>conspiracy</b>, <b>paranoia</b> driving
		  	    	  	elements. Massive flow of such information through centralized social networks, overwhelms the criticial research data
		  	    	  	and often obscures it.
		  	    	</p>

		  	    	<p>
		  	    	  	Searching, Identifying, remembering, of such sources & to further peer review have been an additional burden. Remember
		  	    	  	<b>Information Overload</b> ? When communities form with a governance in it, these false thoughts, unproved data,
		  	    	  	non-peer reviewed, unscientific, conspiracy stories can be weeded out. Such phenomenon is already a part of current
		  	    	  	Internet. With local Organization, problems can be addressed easily, with global ideas and customizations, which might
		  	    	  	not be possible with individual action. This again necessitates availability of peer produced tools & infrastructure
		  	    	  	to curb these erupting dissonance. When individuals economy & business is supported by a commons infrastructure, it
		  	    	  	becomes part of the life, instead of a <b>purchasable unit of commodity from market</b>. Local economies cannot be
		  	    	  	dominated by Centralized Controllers.
