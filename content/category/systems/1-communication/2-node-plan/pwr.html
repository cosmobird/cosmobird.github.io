  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLAIMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The content posted here is not a know how guide to setup a reliable power supply
  	  	  	system for your requirement. I might have attempted to explore and study how to
  	  	  	setup one, that satisfies the requirements for a communication system support structure.
  	  	  	All the stuff here, might change in future and represent completely my organization.
  	  	</p>

		<h3>WHY ?</h3>
	  	<p>
			Communication technology available today needs electrical power to function. Thus the
	  	  	devices used all have a power specification. Since our requirement is to run all day
	  	  	all week all year, with very little maintenance. In particular the maintenance required
	  	  	to have a pattern based on events & conditions in a temporal manner. Moreover, the overall
	  	  	infrastraucture could have monitoring system that can feed the data for management.
	  	  	When the power supply infrastraucture can able to serve <b>(24 x 7 x 365)</b> communication
	  	  	requirement, then it is said that one has setup a <b>offgrid communication</b> infrastraucture.
	  	</p>

		<p>
  	 	  	Mechanism of electric power generation itself consumes lot of natural resource, no matter what
  	 	  	kind is the generation & distribution strategy. The renewable energy generation alternatives like
  	 	  	solar power, wind power, hydel power, geo-thermal power, nuclear power, all consume natural resource
  	 	  	to serve the scale. The effective strategy would be to break the isolation, and let people understand
  	 	  	the difficulties & complexity involved in power generation. Moreover, centralization is much
  	 	  	complex and difficult to maintain.
  	 	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	With decentralized structure, i.e, decentralization towards grass roots, monopoly is neutralized,
  	  	  	simultaneously making people really aware of the system, transparently. People mostly, like
  	  	  	to minize spending, and save it as profit. That is the idea of billing - a measurement
  	  	  	feedback. And it is one of the main reasons, when central power infrastrauctures needs to be
  	  	  	sold to a lot of people, to earn profit, and always keep the profit margin postive - atleast to
  	  	  	aid the workers, and continue maintaining the systems.
  	  	</p>

		<h3>Process :</h3>
	  	<p>
	  	  	As long as electric power is available, communication can be literally sustained for years.
	  	  	Availability of power supply, determines the duty cycle of the communication infrastraucture,
	  	  	which in turn determines the schedule of communication operations. If communication is going
	  	  	to be vital and has to operated continuously to stay connected with the peers, continuous
	  	  	power supply is required. The design has to find a balance between minimizing the power loss,
	  	  	and having devices that can function with less power, without ever compromising the necessary
	  	  	commmunication properties.
	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	With the growth in <b>renewable energy</b> adaptation, <b>offgrid life style</b>, available
  	  	  	number of devices and modules for setting up, power supply system are relatively more than
  	  	  	a few decades ago. Overall the system has three basic units :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>Generation</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Storage</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Distribution</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  		<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../../content/resource/illustrations/comms-communication/power-chain.png" alt="power chain">
  	  	  	<figcaption><b>A Generic Renewable Energy based Power System</b></figcaption>
	  	</figure>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The following factors has to be considered for planning & maintenance:

	  	  	<ul>
	  	  	  <li>Electric power budget</li>
	  	  	  <li>Size of the Generator</li>
	  	  	  <li>Generator capacity</li>
	  	  	  <li>Storage mechanism</li>
	  	  	  <li>Storage capacity</li>
	  	  	  <li>Distribution & Maintenance</li>
	  	  	  <li>Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Power Management</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Safety Control & Fail safe backups</li>
	  	  	  <li>Cost Optimization</li>
	  	  	  <li>Loss Minimization</li>
	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	It is not surprising to see, that such a system, has significant overlap with the renewable
  	  	  	energy system built for a home. For an existing renewable energy system, one has to audit
  	  	  	what is the amount of energy utilized for communication. This makes the habit of measurement
  	  	  	and analysis normative, from which people would realize that resources for communication
  	  	  	do take considerable power, and such a feedback loop will make them energy conscious or even
  	  	  	develop a power management system that would tailor fit their requirement. I personally would
  	  		like to use a machine intelligence system that could do this for me.
  	  	</p>

  		<p>
  			Manual calculation and DIY is so much fun and teaches us a lot through practice. I have enjoyed
  			learning from one of my friend and peer who does power systems research. He has tried implementing
  			a <a href="https://solariiknight.org/post/500w-solar-system">500W Solar system back in 2013</a>.
  			The more key things is his triumph back in 2012 <a href="https://solariiknight.org/post/my-own-solar-power-plant-part-i.html">Part I</a>
  			& <a href="https://solariiknight.org/post/my-own-solar-power-plant-part-ii.html">Part II</a>
  			in which he has written about his experiments in building his own Solar Power Plant.

  			<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-generation"><h3>→ Generation</h3></a>
  			<div id="accordion-generation" class="accordion-section-content">
			  	<p>
					Most of the stuff, modern society lives on - really depend upon massive consumption electric
			  	  	power. With massive requirment, electric power generation as like other infrastrauctures
			  	  	was centralized due to technical and scalability difficulties. Like how a centralized system
			  	  	behaves, this resulted in a <b>isolation</b> between work involved in generation & consumption
			  	  	of the energy. Most of the populace, tend to think, that electric power is available for them
			  	  	at reasonable cost, and consider that it is available without any interruption. Even in developing
			  		countries (with well managed electric power generation & distribution infrastraucture
			  	  	with relatively less resource) - such an expectation is common.
			  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  	  	Electricity is no more an optional utility, but an essential requirement for living in modern
		  	  	  	societies. Even farming methods nowadays heavily depend upon electricity. Using electricity is not
		  	  	  	a problem, but creating a synthetic dependency on the centralized electricity production
		  	  	  	systems is the problem. <b>Energy Saving</b> can become more responsibile when the technology
		  	  	  	enables electricity generation, consumption & maintenance directly to the people. This will
		  	  	  	lessen the burdern of central infrastrauctures and increase the knowledge & awareness than the
		  	  	  	<b>billing</b> strategy.
		  	  	</p>

			  	<h4>Required Modules :</h4>
			  	<p>
					Based on the power requirement, initial estimate of power - i.e, power budget has to be generated
			  	  	which helps in knowing the power consumption on average. This is where power specifications of
			  	  	used appliances will come into picture. Based on geography either solar power or wind power methods
			  	  	can be used.
			  	</p>
  			</div>

		  	<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-storage"><h3>→ Storage</h3></a>
	  		<div id="accordion-storage" class="accordion-section-content">
		  	  	<p>
		  	  		Electricity storage is vital in the self-production method. Without storage, duration of maintenance
		  	  		and repair cannot be handled properly. It provides us with <b>continuous</b> power supply. Furthermore,
		  	  		the storage technology is diversed & varies in cost based upon the chemistry used. So far, we
		  	  		have used <b>chemical storage</b> mechanisms - a.k.a. <b>Battery</b>. The required battery chemistry
		  	  		has to be selected based upon the load requirement, cost & maintenance.
			  	</p>

			  	<h4>Required Modules :</h4>
			  	<p>
			  	  	Every appliance, when equipped with such a self-generation infrastraucture, if possible, has to be
			  	  	attached with its own storage mechanism. This method of localizing storage would isolate the all time
			  	  	dependency on the main infrastraucture, increase reliability, ease maintenance. Storage determines
			  	  	the capacity of supply. This capacity has to be <b>>=</b> to the generation capacity. It must also
			  	  	endure the load variation. Losses between the Generation & Storage, Storage & Distribution has to be
			  	  	taken into account to minimize losses.
			  	</p>
	  		</div>

		  	<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-distribution"><h3>→ Distribution</h3></a>
	  		<div id="accordion-distribution" class="accordion-section-content">
			  	<p>
					The stored energy can be distributed to the load appliances. Most of the time, this invovles a
			  	  	invertor, to convert the DC electric energy to AC electric energy. This inversion process consumes some
			  	  	power for itself, & losses occur. If the appliance are operated directly in DC power standards,
			  	  	then there would not be any additional requirement, apart from safety precautions. This ability
			  	  	is so vital in communication devices, because they are usually vulnerable to Electromagnetic Interference
			  	  	from other appliances in the power network, from external appliances, & ground loop noise.
			  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  	  	With Battery operated devices in constant rise, more and more devices - especially communication devices
		  	  	  	are enabled with batteries. These devices nowadays are measured in terms of communication duty cycle,
		  	  	  	number of calls by full charge - for instance. Such unit of measurements seems to emerge. Since our focus
		  	  	  	is on supplying power for communication appliance, some unit of measurement has to be reached to quantfy
		  	  	  	the performance of the appliance with respect to the power it consumed to provide such performance.
		  	  	</p>

			  	<h4>Required Modules :</h4>
			  	<p>
					To consume power from the Electrical Storage Modules (Batteries), vital power electronics modules are used
			  	  	to provide the required power, while protecting the storage side units from any undesirable events like
			  	  	over load/short circuit.

  		<h3>Power Requirements of a Communication System :</h3>
  		<p>
			The power requirments (load budget) while solely operating it alone through the renewable energy infrastructure,
  			will vary with the kind of technology and its associated tools, devices/instruments. Depending upon the
  			kind of communication infrastraucture the power supply utilization will vary. For instance the following choices
  			might apply :

  			ARRL & other offgrid & emergency services savvy HAM operators have several documents for constructing
  			generator and storage tools. Those documented procedures, and guidelines are based on mostly amateur radio
  			and volunteering for emergency services. While both are essential, the requirement is not always continuous
  			operation and governed by consensus in accessing the net/channel. When the usage is for <b>Internet</b>,
  			where people have the habit of using it in <i>always turned on</i> mode, that makes internet so powerful,
  			requires continuous operation. Thus watt hour calculation might ask more necessary power from the energy
  			storage unit.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Another main differnece between typical Amateur Radio operation and Internet connectivity/communication is
  			that services are mechanized using computing machines, which also requires power for its operation, unlike
  			in HAM radio N/W, where the services are manually run (mostly voice communication).
  		</p>

  	    	</p>

  		<p>
  			With our emphasis on self hosting services and applications, that actually enable one use the communication
  			to the fullest reflects its vital necessity. With more computing power requirement, the power consumed by the
  			services will be more. These services are so vital, that transform a plain connection into communication, &
  			orchestrating information(content,intent) into secure communication. Applications and Services are the frontfacing
  			interface to the user. No matter how complex is the underlying communication infrastructure, that handles
  			all the heavy lifting, for a user, communication resides in the interface.
  		</p>

  		<h3>My Home Setup :</h3>
  		<p>
  			The following explanation is completely a subjective experience. I have a HAM radio license, which i am not using
  			for anything. It become a subject of DIY for me, which i have planned for later. However, i do have a software
  			controlled radio, which we cooperatively built by soldering ourselves the printed circuit board & components, with
  			warm help from our HAM Elmers in one of the workshop. I have always sincerely felt very grateful to them, in
  			sharing so much about its technical and system level details and stuff.
  		</p>

	  	</figure>

  		<p>
  			I also use Internet for my day to day communication requirement. I am a noob when it comes to computer, software
  			and stuff. Being part of this community network group locally, i enjoyed fun in learning so much about self hosting,
  			commons communication infrastructure, community radio networks, distributed systems and all that awesome stuff.
  			With love in both the communication paradigms, i cant stop learning, and i am still learning.
  		</p>

		<p>
  			Apart from serving other home appliances, i have the following communication appliances connected :

  		</p>

  		<p>
  			<ul>
  				<li><b>Generation:</b>
  				    	<p>
		  			I have not yet setted up a generator in my home. Since it is kind of relatively heavy investment for me,
		  			i would add that to the power infrastraucture later. However, for now, i am just using mains power supply
		  			of 220V, from the distribution transformer through the Online - Uninterruptable Power Supply unit. Thus
  				    	i am actually just consuming the grid power. <i>No generation yet !</i>
		  			</p>

  				</li>
  				<li><b>Storage:</b>
  					<p>
		  			My home has this huge Lead-Acid battery with capacity rating of C20, which can deliver whooping 150Ah of current
		  			@ 12V. Local power policies & economic situations have driven almost every family in our state to install
		  			a inverter and battery to operate their home appliances in the event of power failure - that happens very
		  			frequently.
