  	  	<h3>WHAT IS INFRASTRUCTURE ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
			Infrastructure is reality. It is the real stuff which we depend on to live daily. It is the
  	  	  	collective reflection of our survival capability. We humans are basically animals. Are we
  	  	  	social beings ?.. well i dont know yet ! However, we have been changing our infrastructure
  	  	  	by displacing ourselves since our inception, and then we tried to change the infrastructure
  	  	  	using our intellectual curiosity, that led explore and discover stuff to understand a wider
  	  	  	scope, which in turn provide us with information about the required infrastructure for our
  	  	  	survival that can provide us with expected features & facilities.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/illustrations/infrastructures/Collective-Survival.png" alt="collective survival">
  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>fig.1.</i> Natural Infrastructure</b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Now for a <b>stable survival</b>, we expect a fundamanetal infrastructure which is deterministically
  	  	  	stronger and immune to disruptive changes. To start we designed the architectures that are necessary
  	  	  	to build these infrastructures that we expect. Thus infrastructure is now the implementation of
  	  	  	the architecture where our expectations are embedded in its design. right ?
  	  	</p>

  	  	<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/illustrations/infrastructures/from-necessity-to-infrastructure.png" alt="syntesized infrastructure">
  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>fig.2.</i> Synthesized Infrastructure</b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	To obtain stability in survival, we have formed commonly agreed laws, policies, rules, that are
  	  	  	not deterimental to liberty of the people, but only sufficient enough to regulate and maintain
  	  	  	the loops consistently to enable a constant flow of resources. After establishing a stable infrastructure,
  	  	  	the <b>routine</b> or <b>loop</b> is executed on timely patterned manner with <b>duty cycle</b>, to
  	  	  	transform the natural resources into goods and consumable fuel that are necessary to sustain the operation
  	  	  	of the infrastructure. We live over this abstracted and isolation providing infrastructures that helped
  	  	  	us to expand our curiosity, exploration, giving rise to new expectations that updates or replaces the
  	  	  	existing necessities. These expectations are then termed as new necessities and the whole process is followed
  	  	  	once again, to update the current one or create another infrastructure that satisfies the new expectation.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/illustrations/infrastructures/new-expectations.png" alt="new-expectations">
  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>fig.3.</i> Construction enforced with Expectation Feedback</b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  	  	<h3>IS IT NECESSARY ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Survival strategies, Design, Architecture, Organization, & Infrastructure are all part of the process.
  	  	  	One could not isolate just one of them and discuss about it alone. We live our lives on the infrastructures
  	  	  	which are obvious but, some would only recognize only after mentioning it. For instance :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>Time ( think about it )</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Food Production & Distribution</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Communications</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Transport & Logistics</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Governance</li>
  	  	  	  <li>....</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	No matter how much abstract we could go about infrastructures, end of the day they all depend upon the
  	  	  	Physical resources. It is with the technology in hand we transport all these resources available in the
  	  	  	environment and transform into inputs and outputs of several infrastructures & some times we make
  	  	  	infrastructures using them recursively.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/illustrations/infrastructures/human-loops-constancy.png" alt="collective survival">
  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>fig.4.</i> Human Loops & treadmills for constant generation of Resources & Infrastructures</b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  	  	<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/illustrations/infrastructures/distances.png" alt="distances">
  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>fig.5.</i> Increasing distance, demands more transparency</b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Transforming resources into supplies is hard work and we do it, because the method has proved to provide
  	  	  	us with stable survival strategy. This has recursively enabled us, to save more time that let us think
  	  	  	and contemplate our curiosities without any fear of survival. Thus with more and more free time, feautres,
  	  	  	services we yield from the current infrastructure, we tend to do it indefinetely by erecting loops &
  	  	  	treadmills that does and maintains this <b>cycle</b> constantly. We <b>want</b> it to be constant. Thus one part
  	  	  	of the people in the society would naturally be subjugated, deprived liberty, emotionally motivated to serve
  	  	  	this purpose, so that the remaining part would follow their curiosity. With growing population, everyone wants
  	  	  	to migrate to the interesting side of the offer, which is regulated using competition, prerequisite & qualitification
  	  	  	strategies. Who are these <b>loopy people</b> who enables the cycles, for exmaple ?

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>farmers</li>
  	  	  	  <li>miners</li>
  	  	  	  <li>bureaucratic workers</li>
  	  	  	  <li>security providers</li>
  	  	  	  <li>...</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>WHAT'S THE PROBLEM ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Well, the people who constructs the infrastructure using some basic design of architecture, tend to end up
  	  	  	bifurcated or multifurcated, just to serve back the infrastructure itself. Now, the terrible question is, whether
  	  	  	these humans end up serving the infrastructure or the other way round which was originally envisoned ? While it
  	  	  	is not fair to divide and privelege people by themselves to enjoy the fruits while the remaining toil !.
  	  	  	Moreover, with time, our dependency on these centralized structures become more and more intimate and tight,
  	  	  	to a point where distinction between the structure and the people is no more recognizable.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/illustrations/infrastructures/people-furcation.png" alt="people furcation">
  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>fig.6.</i> People divided with occupation to make the loops run with stability</b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	All these conditions are emergent, and originally it might never be intended to reach a state like this at all.
  	  	  	This situation provides us with the following three options :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>flow along the system's infrastructures path</li>
  	  	  	  <li>stop & think of tinkering, fix it through updates</li>
  	  	  	  <li>think of alternative designs, architectures proposing a new structure</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	With these systems, loops, treadmills, infrastructures in place, and year after year people depend on it for
  	  	  	their livelihood, simply tends to believe that it is with the infrastructure they can sustain their life.
  	  	  	Moreover, they firmly believe that without these infrastructures, life is not possible. This <b>dependency
			indicator</b> is a clear measure of ignorance, and infrastructure's creepy control over one's life. In first place,
  	  	  	we have innovated methods to create these infrastructures to let us think freely, while the emergent situation
  	  	  	seems to indicate a diametrically opposite status.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	As illustrated in the fig.5, the distance between the stages of the deterministic process increases
  	  	  	further and further and tends to extend even more, when the expected comfort zones are more abstract, and at
  	  	  	the comfort zone, only the preluding layers operations might be obviously visible, if transparency is provided
  	  	  	along with the abstraction. Observation always demands transparency. It is only when this <b>regulating feature</b>
  	  	  	is demanded, it will be included in the design, and future implementation makes it easier for observors
  	  	  	to gather information, and atleast propose updates, solutions for the problem they prioritized. It does not matter
  	  	  	how many eyes are observing, when the operations are fundamentally obscured or manipulated to show <b>simulated
  	  	  	reality</b>.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	So far one can see, that the following 5 parameters are influential in regulating the infrastructure beasts
  	  	  	to keep them in check to bring the balance in power & responsibility :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>distance between process stages</li>
  	  	  	  <li>transparency vs. obscurity</li>
  	  	  	  <li>accountability</li>
  	  	  	  <li>observation vs. isolation</li>
  	  	  	  <li>social auditing vs. authoritative inspection</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>HOW ITS MADE ?</h3>
  	 	<p>
  	 	  	Every system is derived from network of systems embedded in the architectural design. Initially infrastructures
  	 	  	are then constructed to fulfill several necessities, which are again netwoked to form a super infrastructure
  	 	  	that depends upon these smaller infrastructure. To keep these systems away from disturbances, the design
  	 	  	infuses defensive or oppressive loops in the architecture itself, which will later fight against those disturbances,
  	 	  	if they occur. Learning from the past, will help mitigate the known and measured disturbances, and designers will
  	 	  	have to design by predicting all possible future disruptions that might occur. This makes the infrastructure live. It
  	 	  	recognizes time and depends on time, it now can learn from the past, could have a intended future, and its going to
  	 	  	last as long as people feel contend with it. Furthermore, the implementation (infrastructure) includes humans in the
  	 	  	loop to make it work for which it is designed & erected. Thus every system so far we have made were essentially
  	 	  	infrastructures - that too highly centralized.
  	 	</p>

  	  	<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/illustrations/infrastructures/super-structures.png" alt="super-structures">
  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>fig.7.</i> Highly centralized super infrastructure derived dependency from smaller structures</b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  	  	<p>
  	 	  	It is no more a system of machines, run by deterministic machines, which can be programmed to execute
  	 	  	according to conditions, rather it becomes a sentinel, that can react, respond, defend, or even oppress &
  	 	  	attack when it sees fit and necessary. Thus it is upto we humans, to observe it carefully, regulate it, or even change
  	  	  	it by updating it or raising completely a new altenative. If most of the people are <b>ignorant</b>, then the
  	  	  	weakness in the current infrastructure might be used against itself & the people depending on it. Generally, every
  	  	  	human is ignorant, inspite of their power, influence, financial, economic, & social capital. Nobody, can define
  	  	  	the limits of ignorance. We all are ignorants. All we do is follow the curiosity, take a leap of faith every
  	  	  	now and then, with courage and confidence, and open up the blockades of ignorance - which we call as discovery.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
			On the other hand, as shown in fig.5, if distance d1, d2, d3, d4 ... are taken in advantage for obscuring the
  	  	  	functionality, then it significantly raises <b>induced ignorance</b> among the people. This remarkably increases the
  	  	  	weaknesses of the system, which eventually reflects as <b>denial of transparency</b>. When transparency &
  	  	  	accountability are denied for the sake of stability, then the infrastructure creeps away from the commonly
  	  	  	accepted design & architectural properties. This imbalances the power of control.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	It is not only that people gets stressed when new expectations are demanded from the infrastructure, but also the
  	  	  	resources which we transform as products for the expectations do become victims of stress. Once if the resources
  	  	  	exhausts, we either search for a better resource or look for other locations instead of changing our design
  	  	  	patterns and solutions. Even to know that the resources are under stress, the data collected must have a transparent
  	  	  	channel to communicate publicly. This simple adaptation, changes the whole regulation process through social
  	  	  	auditing.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>WHAT IF ?</h3>
		<p>
  	  	  	What will happen, if the infrastructure is experiencing a massing hit emerging internally or
  	  	  	externally , that overwhelms its threshold of pain, and loses control ? The following options
  	  	  	can be observed from history :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>instead of responding, it might react to the disruption (distress due to fear)</li>
  	  	  	  <li>would defend itself or oppress the disruption/change in extreme</li>
  	  	  	  <li>some times responds, and progressively adapts to fit itself for change</li>
  	  	  	  <li>some times defeated by uprise, and a alternative infrastructure raises</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
			What will happen if the infrastructure, abstracts more and more, to a state where the fundamanetal
  	  	  	architecture is not obviously transparent. One cannot refute, it is not transparent, but at the same
  	  	  	time cannot comprehend its presence & meaning hindered by the complexities of infrastructure itself. Then
  	  	  	there might be a chance that the infrastructure and the features built on top of its platform could
  	  	  	use such difficulty - as a loophole to gain which it values as profit. Infrastructure by default derives
  	  	  	its power from the people who constructed it and who lives in it. All the platforms built on top of
  	  	  	it were again to serve the people in it. With people depending upon the infrastructure, and growing
  	  	  	ignorant about its complex orchestration, lose the default transparency and accountability from the
  	  	  	erected infrastructure.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>DEEPER DIVE !</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Hence, we cannot escape the sphere of ignorance, and all we can do is to open it up one by one, little by little,
  	  	  	to reach a much wider knowledge. We used to call it as Thinking, Learning, & Educating - hoping us to organize
  	  	  	the knowledge we have interpreted, learned & understood. In the process we unlearn a lot of things, and learn
  	  	  	lot of things - updating ourselves, our mindsets, our thought process to reach out further. This explains, that
  	  	  	we are basically explorers, driven by curiosities. Hierarchy and time influences us a lot more than we actually
  	  	  	think of them. They both help us organize information, knowledge and regulate the versions of knowledge, to
  	  	  	ease the unlearning & learning process.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	With ever expanding knowledge, we really don't seem to change the way we construct our infrastructures, and we
  	  	  	always seems to care only about constancy, stability, run for eternity. We even constructed other infrastructures
  	  	  	that make the updating process so tedious, which we often point our fingers as a reason for not changing
  	  	  	ourselves. Fundamentally it is a question of : "What is the use of so much knowledge, organization, anti-ignorance
  	  	  	we have learned, while we let most of us behind to churn out constant supply of survival resources ?"
  	  	</p>

	  	<h3>SO ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	A significant change in the established normative state, that either struggles to adapt the change or refuses to
  	  	  	accept the change, can be deserted by the people in a ideas scenario leaving the system empty, with people
  	  	  	left in distress who were until now dependent upon the infrastructure for their livelihood. So a <b>social mobilization</b>
  	  	  	strategy is required, that can handle the <b>transition</b>, must be in place to gather people, educate, and
  	  	  	make them realize the adverse effects of present system, how to rectify it, to start think for alternatives and so on....
  	  	  	To make this work, the underlying architecture has to be redesigned with one of the following strategies:

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>update one stuff at a time</li>
  	  	  	  <li>design different alternatives</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/illustrations/infrastructures/update-change.png" alt="update-change">
  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>fig.8.</i> Updating Strategy & Alternatives Strategy</b></figcaption>
  	  	</figure>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The above illustrated strategies can even be mixed, to decide on a particular alternative, and to use time to update the
  	  	  	current systems architecture one step at a time, by deconstructing it from the initial version and slowly reconstructing
  	  	  	it aligning towards the critically reviewed alternative. This adds the advantage to reach out to the public, make them
  	  	  	aware by propagating the flaws, loopholes, unnecessary complexities, in the system. One has to observe that the initial
  	  	  	version might be a corrupted version of a originally neutral version.
		</p>

  	  	<blockquote>
  	  	  	i.e, initial version <b>!=</b> origin version
  	  	</blockquote>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Thus it also facilitates to <b>reset</b> the systems nature and functionality to the default case, while adding the
  	  	  	necessary updates required to attack the corruption or creep which previously infected the systems functionality and operation.
  	  	  	Compare whether the new ideas/architectures & design address the limitations in the earlier system and solves them, or
  	  	  	does it empowers only the existing advantages. Address limitations alone, or empowering advantages alone is not a balanced
  	  	  	functionality and will most likely end in detrimental operation sooner than expected, as the new update or new design
  	  	  	favours a partial view of the system without ever properly understanding it. Even in a collaborative effort, care has
  	  	  	to be taken to see that this does not occur as far as possible.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<blockquote>
  	  	  	As you might have already recognized, i have just imitated this strategy from a distributed software revision control system.
  	  	</blockquote>

  	  	<h3>ANSWERS ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	It depends on :
  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>how much we keep informed ourselves, through independency ?</li>
  	  	  	  <li>how much clarity in analysis we reach ?</li>
  	  	  	  <li>what actions we take to keep the systems in check for transparency & accountability ?</li>
  	  	  	  <li>what actions we take to keep the systems, networks, infrastructure, architectures lean & mean ?</li>
  	  	  	  <li>how we are going to participate in governance ?</li>
  	  	  	  <li>how much power & responsibility we are going to transform to a central control ?</li>
  	  	  	  <li>how much deliberate, critical, conscious of : asymmetry, unjust laws ?</li>
  	  	  	  <li>how we maintain the transparency of mechanisms ? who controls the policies ?</li>
  	  	  	  <li>how we are going to be collaboratively united ?</li>
  	  	  	  <li>who owns the infrastructures, who observes the checks & balances ?</li>
  	  	  	  <li>what strategies we use to regulate organizational clarity ?</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	We have stayed contend with the <b>stable survival loops</b> instead of thinking about <b>flexible sustenance
  	  	  	ideas & strategies.</b> We are not here to just survive. We are here to live, and live with liberty. Instead of
  	  	  	designing architectures with stability and security alone, they have to be innovated with flexibility and
  	  	  	adaptibility. This would make the infrastructures adaptive to changes, while not pushing the people towards
  	  	  	a ignorant territory, but embraces them along with the change. If there is a fundamental design or architectural
  	  	  	flaw, they need to be addressed instead of patching the effects through obscurity.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Will the infrastructures become adaptible if they are owned by the <b>commons</b>, like commons land, commons
  	  	  	governance, commons communication networks, commons transport networks, commons food & farming networks... ?
  	  	  	that requires wider & deeper critical thinking. We are not sure about anything, but atleast it does not harms
  	  	  	us to try those strategies for building up some of the current infrastructures in a commons design point of view.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>WHAT'S THE POINT ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	There might be no point in me writing this, or you reading this. In fact, this writeup may not make any sense to
  	  	  	you at all. If it makes some sense, then i believe that it might provide you with some questions to think
  	  	  	about or at best, drives you to try to think about some alternative ideas & solutions.
