  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLIAMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The content posted here is not a know how guide to setup a reliable power supply
  	  	  	system for your requirement. I might have attempted to explore and study how to
  	  	  	setup one, that satisfies the requirements for a communication system support structure.
  	  	  	All the stuff here, might change in future and represent completely my organization.
  	  	</p>

		<h3>WHY ?</h3>
	  	<p>
			Communication technology available today needs electrical power to function. Thus the
	  	  	devices used all have a power specification. Since our requirement is to run all day
	  	  	all week all year, with very little maintenance. In particular the maintenance required
	  	  	to have a pattern based on events & conditions in a temporal manner. Moreover, the overall
	  	  	infrastraucture could have monitoring system that can feed the data for management.
	  	  	When the power supply infrastraucture can able to serve <b>(24 x 7 x 365)</b> communication
	  	  	requirement, then it is said that one has setup a <b>offgrid communication</b> infrastraucture.
	  	</p>

		<p>
  	 	  	Mechanism of electric power generation itself consumes lot of natural resource, no matter what
  	 	  	kind is the generation & distribution strategy. The renewable energy generation alternatives like
  	 	  	solar power, wind power, hydel power, geo-thermal power, nuclear power, all consume natural resource
  	 	  	to serve the scale. The effective strategy would be to break the isolation, and let people understand
  	 	  	the difficulties & complexity involved in power generation. Moreover, centralization is much
  	 	  	complex and difficult to maintain.
  	 	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	With decentralized structure, i.e, decentralization towards grass roots, monopoly is neutralized,
  	  	  	simultaneously making people really aware of the system, transparently. People mostly, like
  	  	  	to minize spending, and save it as profit. That is the idea of billing - a measurement
  	  	  	feedback. And it is one of the main reasons, when central power infrastrauctures needs to be
  	  	  	sold to a lot of people, to earn profit, and always keep the profit margin postive - atleast to
  	  	  	aid the workers, and continue maintaining the systems.
  	  	</p>

		<h3>Process :</h3>
	  	<p>
	  	  	As long as electric power is available, communication can be literally sustained for years.
	  	  	Availability of power supply, determines the duty cycle of the communication infrastraucture,
	  	  	which in turn determines the schedule of communication operations. If communication is going
	  	  	to be vital and has to operated continuously to stay connected with the peers, continuous
	  	  	power supply is required. The design has to find a balance between minimizing the power loss,
	  	  	and having devices that can function with less power, without ever compromising the necessary
	  	  	commmunication properties.
	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	With the growth in <b>renewable energy</b> adaptation, <b>offgrid life style</b>, available
  	  	  	number of devices and modules for setting up, power supply system are relatively more than
  	  	  	a few decades ago. Overall the system has three basic units :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>Generation</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Storage</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Distribution</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Safety Control & Fail safe backups</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Power Management</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	It is not surprising to see, that such a system, has significant overlap with the renewable
  	  	  	energy system built for a home. For an existing renewable energy system, one has to audit
  	  	  	what is the amount of energy utilized for communication. This makes measurement necessary
  	  	  	and analysis becomes habit, from which people would realize that resources for communication
  	  	  	do take considerable power, and such a feedback loop will make them energy conscious or even
  	  	  	develop a power management system that would tailor fit their requirement.
  	  	</p>

	  	<h3>Generation</h3>
	  	<p>
			Most of the stuff, modern society lives on really depend upon massive consumption electric
	  	  	power. With massive requirment, electric power generation as like other infrastrauctures
	  	  	was centralized due to technical and scalability difficulties. Like how a centralized system
	  	  	behaves, this resulted in a <b>isolation</b> between work involved in generation & consumption
	  	  	of the energy. Most of the populace, tend to think, that electric power is available for them
	  	  	at reasonable cost, and consider that it is available without any interruption. Even in
	  	  	developing countries (with well managed electric power generation & distribution infrastraucture
	  	  	with relatively less resource) - such an expectation is common.
