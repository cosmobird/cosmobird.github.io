  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLIAMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The content posted here is not a know how guide to setup a reliable power supply
  	  	  	system for your requirement. I might have attempted to explore and study how to
  	  	  	setup one, that satisfies the requirements for a communication system support structure.
  	  	  	All the stuff here, might change in future and represent completely my organization.
  	  	</p>

		<h3>WHY ?</h3>
	  	<p>
			Communication technology available today needs electrical power to function. Thus the
	  	  	devices used all have a power specification. Since our requirement is to run all day
	  	  	all week all year, with very little maintenance. In particular the maintenance required
	  	  	to have a pattern based on events & conditions in a temporal manner. Moreover, the overall
	  	  	infrastraucture could have monitoring system that can feed the data for management.
	  	  	When the power supply infrastraucture can able to serve <b>(24 x 7 x 365)</b> communication
	  	  	requirement, then it is said that one has setup a <b>offgrid communication</b> infrastraucture.
	  	</p>

		<p>
  	 	  	Mechanism of electric power generation itself consumes lot of natural resource, no matter what
  	 	  	kind is the generation & distribution strategy. The renewable energy generation alternatives like
  	 	  	solar power, wind power, hydel power, geo-thermal power, nuclear power, all consume natural resource
  	 	  	to serve the scale. The effective strategy would be to break the isolation, and let people understand
  	 	  	the difficulties & complexity involved in power generation. Moreover, centralization is much
  	 	  	complex and difficult to maintain.
  	 	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	With decentralized structure, i.e, decentralization towards grass roots, monopoly is neutralized,
  	  	  	simultaneously making people really aware of the system, transparently. People mostly, like
  	  	  	to minize spending, and save it as profit. That is the idea of billing - a measurement
  	  	  	feedback. And it is one of the main reasons, when central power infrastrauctures needs to be
  	  	  	sold to a lot of people, to earn profit, and always keep the profit margin postive - atleast to
  	  	  	aid the workers, and continue maintaining the systems.
  	  	</p>

		<h3>Process :</h3>
	  	<p>
	  	  	As long as electric power is available, communication can be literally sustained for years.
	  	  	Availability of power supply, determines the duty cycle of the communication infrastraucture,
	  	  	which in turn determines the schedule of communication operations. If communication is going
	  	  	to be vital and has to operated continuously to stay connected with the peers, continuous
	  	  	power supply is required. The design has to find a balance between minimizing the power loss,
	  	  	and having devices that can function with less power, without ever compromising the necessary
	  	  	commmunication properties.
	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	With the growth in <b>renewable energy</b> adaptation, <b>offgrid life style</b>, available
  	  	  	number of devices and modules for setting up, power supply system are relatively more than
  	  	  	a few decades ago. Overall the system has three basic units :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>Generation</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Storage</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Distribution</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  		<figure>
  	  	  	<img src="../../../../../content/resource/illustrations/comms-communication/power-chain.png" alt="power chain">
  	  	  	<figcaption><b>A Generic Renewable Energy based Power System</b></figcaption>
	  	</figure>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The following factors has to be considered for planning & maintenance:

	  	  	<ul>
	  	  	  <li>Electric power budget</li>
	  	  	  <li>Size of the Generator</li>
	  	  	  <li>Generator capacity</li>
	  	  	  <li>Storage mechanism</li>
	  	  	  <li>Storage capacity</li>
	  	  	  <li>Distribution & Maintenance</li>
	  	  	  <li>Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Power Management</li>
  	  	  	  <li>Safety Control & Fail safe backups</li>
	  	  	  <li>Cost Optimization</li>
	  	  	  <li>Loss Minimization</li>
	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	It is not surprising to see, that such a system, has significant overlap with the renewable
  	  	  	energy system built for a home. For an existing renewable energy system, one has to audit
  	  	  	what is the amount of energy utilized for communication. This makes the habit of measurement
  	  	  	and analysis normative, from which people would realize that resources for communication
  	  	  	do take considerable power, and such a feedback loop will make them energy conscious or even
  	  	  	develop a power management system that would tailor fit their requirement.

  			<div id="accordion-1" class="accordion-section-content">
			  	<p>
					Most of the stuff, modern society lives on - really depend upon massive consumption electric
			  	  	power. With massive requirment, electric power generation as like other infrastrauctures
			  	  	was centralized due to technical and scalability difficulties. Like how a centralized system
			  	  	behaves, this resulted in a <b>isolation</b> between work involved in generation & consumption
			  	  	of the energy. Most of the populace, tend to think, that electric power is available for them
			  	  	at reasonable cost, and consider that it is available without any interruption. Even in developing
			  		countries (with well managed electric power generation & distribution infrastraucture
			  	  	with relatively less resource) - such an expectation is common.
			  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  	  	Electricity is no more an optional utility, but an essential requirement for living in modern
		  	  	  	societies. Even farming methods nowadays heavily depend upon electricity. Using electricity is not
		  	  	  	a problem, but creating a synthetic dependency on the centralized electricity production
		  	  	  	systems is the problem. <b>Energy Saving</b> can become more responsibile when the technology
		  	  	  	enables electricity generation, consumption & maintenance directly to the people. This will
		  	  	  	lessen the burdern of central infrastrauctures and increase the knowledge & awareness than the
		  	  	  	<b>billing</b> strategy.
		  	  	</p>

			  	<h3>Required Modules :</h3>
			  	<p>
					Based on the power requirement, initial estimate of power - i.e, power budget has to be generated
			  	  	which helps in knowing the power consumption on average. This is where power specifications of
			  	  	used appliances will come into picture. Based on geography either solar power or wind power methods
			  	  	can be used.
			  	</p>

		  	<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-2"><h3>→ Storage</h3></a>
	  		<div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">
		  	  	<p>
		  	  		Electricity storage is vital in the self-production method. Without storage, duration of maintenance
		  	  		and repair cannot be handled properly. It provides us with <b>continuous</b> power supply. Furthermore,
		  	  		the storage technology is diversed & varies in cost based upon the chemistry used. So far, we
		  	  		have used <b>chemical storage</b> mechanisms - a.k.a. <b>Battery</b>. The required battery chemistry
		  	  		has to be selected based upon the load requirement, cost & maintenance.
			  	</p>

			  	<h3>Required Modules :</h3>
			  	<p>
			  	  	Every appliance, when equipped with such a self-generation infrastraucture, if possible, has to be
			  	  	attached with its own storage mechanism. This method of localizing storage would isolate the all time
			  	  	dependency on the main infrastraucture, increase reliability, ease maintenance. Storage determines
			  	  	the capacity of supply. This capacity has to be <b>>=</b> to the generation capacity. It must also
			  	  	endure the load variation. Losses between the Generation & Storage, Storage & Distribution has to be
			  	  	taken into account to minimize losses.
			  	</p>
	  		</div>

		  	<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-3"><h3>→ Distribution</h3></a>
	  		<div id="accordion-3" class="accordion-section-content">
			  	<p>
					The stored energy can be distributed to the load appliances. Most of the time, this invovles a
			  	  	invertor, to convert the DC electric energy to AC electric energy. This inversion process consumes some
			  	  	power for itself, & losses occur. If the appliance are operated directly in DC power standards,
			  	  	then there would not be any additional requirement, apart from safety precautions. This ability
			  	  	is so vital in communication devices, because they are usually vulnerable to Electromagnetic Interference
			  	  	from other appliances in the power network, from external appliances, & ground loop noise.
			  	</p>

		  	  	<p>
		  	  	  	With Battery operated devices in constant rise, more and more devices - especially communication devices
		  	  	  	are enabled with batteries. These devices nowadays are measured in terms of communication duty cycle,
		  	  	  	number of calls by full charge - for instance. Such unit of measurements seems to emerge. Since our focus
		  	  	  	is on supplying power for communication appliance, some unit of measurement has to be reached to quantfy
		  	  	  	the performance of the appliance with respect to the power it consumed to provide such performance.
		  	  	</p>

			  	<h3>Required Modules :</h3>
			  	<p>
					To consume power from the Electrical Storage Modules (Batteries), vital power electronics modules are used
			  	  	to provide the required power, while protecting the storage side units from any undesirable events like
			  	  	over load/short circuit.
