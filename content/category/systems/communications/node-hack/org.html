  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Hi there ! after reading the previous two posts on communication infrastructure, & social audit, its
  	  	  	influence on driving the fundamental questions about the way we connected, which might either make
  	  	  	you feel bored or helped u think further, i believe, that this & following posts will discuss about
  	  	  	the Design, Organization, Architectural, Practicality aspects of Commons Communication Infrastructure.
  	  	  	Contents are subject to update.
  	  	</p>

		<h3>WHY ?</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Every communication infrastructure requires an architectural organization, in order to
  	  	  	understand how the systems are connected together, based on their requirement & purpose,
  	  	  	with other subsystems or submodules. This architectural layout simply illustrates the
  	  	  	interfacing between the subsystems. Orchestration of this architecture results in a
  	  	  	implementable system having a <b>degree of modularity</b>. To achieve flexibility in the
  	  	  	system design, modularity is essential.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>Through the basics !</h3>
  	  	<p>
			Thus before opening the doors of excursion towards a life style for self reliable and self
  	  	  	hosted peer prodused emergent Internet, it is wise to know how & why the modules are orchestrated
  	  	  	based on requirements & expected flexibility. This necessitates one, to understand the
  	  	  	basic operations of a Communication System in general Technical terms. I believe a short discourse
  	  	  	would provide the required lexicon that will guide your further in interpreting the integration of
  	  	  	systems for communication.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<h3>Communication System</h3>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Any communication infrastructure will atleast require two parties and a common medium connected
  	  	  	between the two. The pre-requisite is that the two parties could understand each other languages
  	  	  	or speak the same language or create a new language to facilitate their communication wisely. Thus
  	  	  	the three conditions are :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>atleast 2 parties ( parties >= 2)</li>
  	  	  	  <li>common medium</li>
  	  	  	  <li>common language</li>
  	  	  	</ul>

  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Let us consider a simplistic model of real world situation, two persons talking with each other...
  	  	  	Keeping the parties & language as a known constant, they could converse using the following mediums :

	  	  	  	<figcaption><b>Simplistic Communication view</b></figcaption>
	  	  	</figure>

  	  	  	<ol>
  	  	  	  <li><h4>Script based information + intelligent carrier + physical transportation</h4>
				<p>
					Intentions are represented though the scripts defined by the chosen & agreed language
				  	of communication. The parties involved communicate with each other by employing a
				  	intelligent & loyal carrier or either semi-intelligent carrier to transfer information
				  	to and fro. Thus the scripts are the information which will be interpreted back as
				  	original intentions of the sender by the reciever. Usually humans or any other animals
				  	trained to carry the information is the communication medium here. Thus the reliability
				  	of communication completely depends upon the the medium employed.
				</p>

		  	  	  	<figcaption><b>Third party dependency</b></figcaption>
	  	  		</figure>
  	  	  	    	<figure>
		  	  	  	<img src="../../../../../content/resource/illustrations/comms-communication/script-medium-parameters.png" alt="dependency parameters">
		  	  	  	<figcaption><b>Dependency parameters</b></figcaption>
	  	  		</figure>
  	  	  	    	<p>
  	  	  	    	  	What are all the parameters that influence the selection of communication medium ?

  	  	  	    	  	<ul>
  	  	  	    	  	  <li>Spatial Distance</li>
  	  	  	    	  	  <li>Secrecy</li>
  	  	  	    	  	  <li>Life support</li>
  	  	  	    	  	</ul>
  	  	  	    	</p>
  	  	  	    	<p>
  	  	  	    	  	Here the link between the parties, always refreshed by the frequency of transportation
  	  	  	    	  	executed by the intelligent carrier. Thus the carrier (human or bird or animals) used for
  	  	  	    	  	for transportation establishes the link which in turn is interpreted as the medium of
  	  	  	    	  	communication.
  	  	  	    	</p>
  	  	  	  </li>
  	  	  	  <li><h4>Electrical information + electromagnetic carrier + link layout</h4>
				<p>
					With the discovery of electromagnetics, radio, and formation of electromagnetic field
				  	theory, advancements in semiconducting electronics, information theory : created massive
				  	disruption in the way we communicate with each other. Communication needs no more
				  	intervention of humans or birds - instead replaced with systems which can continuously
				  	be operated to enable communication.
				</p>
  	  	  	    	<p>
  	  	  	    	  	Suddenly everybody can afford to own a communication channel, and whoever subscribes to
  	  	  	    	  	lease a communication channel, can readily converse with the other using some unique
  	  	  	    	  	identification. This seeded the social & private communication media. In the realm of mass
  	  	  	    	  	communication, similar technology was adapted using broadcasting mechanisms which merrily
  	  	  	    	  	accelerate propaganda and speeches of leaders to reach the masses within blink of an eye.
  	  	  	    	</p>
  	  	  	    	<figure>
		  	  	  	<img src="../../../../../content/resource/illustrations/comms-communication/communication-indirect-radio-medium.png" alt="comm-radio">
		  	  	  	<figcaption><b>Simplistic but Radio based Communication view</b></figcaption>
	  	  		</figure>
  	  	  	    	<p>
  	  	  	    	  	People are no more seperated by Spatial Distance. Electromagnetic field & affordable Electronics
  	  	  	    	  	virtually eradicated the distance. With rapid changes in mechanized communication systems,
  	  	  	    	  	every human in the loop doing repeting stuff are replaced by every increasing electronic
  	  	  	    	  	machines which decreases the supply of life support mechanisms & policies in the infrastructure.
  	  	  	    	</p>
  	  	  	    	<p>
  	  	  	    	  	With more & more democratization of communication systems, it gained social mass,
  	  	  	    	  	which further raised the pressure on improving technologies that could scale with the
  	  	  	    	  	density of participation. This created a <b>perpetual loop</b> between the technology & social
  	  	  	    	  	gravity.
  	  	  	    	</p>
  	  	  	    	<p>
  	  	  	    	  	Now the influence is shifted towards a different set of parameters :

  	  	  	    	  	<ul>
  	  	  	    	  	  <li>Content Density</li>
  	  	  	    	  	  <li>Capacity (number of subscribers)</li>
  	  	  	    	  	  <li>Medium Sharing & Management</li>
  	  	  	    	  	</ul>
  	  	  	    	</p>
  	  	  	  </li>
  	  	  	</ol>
  	  	</p>

		<h3>Enjoy the Transition <b>:)</b></h3>
  	  	<p>
			Technology is itself a continuum of transitions adapting changes that arise from time to time.
  	  	  	Communication technology is no matter different from it, and thus people has to adapt for it
  	  	  	provides the necessary facility that enable them to communicate - a vital necessity for survival.
  	  	  	When the degree of change is rapid, probabilistically there is a good chance for people to
  	  	  	get confused about choosing a system that is right for them. Similarly when one is interested
  	  	  	in taking a self-reliance path for communication, they will adapt to the requirements and available
  	  	  	systems.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Transitioning from a centralized communication infrastructure towards a alternate emergent
  	  	  	communication system will have its troughs & valleys providing an artistic perspective along with a
  	  	  	scientific perspective to the practice. It is about being part of the change itself, rather than
  	  	  	only enjoying the fruits of change. This marks the true participation for a democratic & rightful
  	  	  	owning of the infrastructure in cultural form.

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>let Communication be part of Human Culture and not be a part of Profit churning Automaton !</li>
  	  	  	  <li>let Communication be a Necessity & Human Right</li>
  	  	  	  <li>let Communication <b>not</b> be a Commodity</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	</p>
