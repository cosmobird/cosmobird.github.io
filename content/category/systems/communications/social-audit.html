  	  	<p>
  	  	  	The nay sayers of decentralization/federation oriented towards grass roots emergence, and those
  	  	  	who have misunderstood the <b>Tragedy of Commons</b>, will find this writing certainly repulsive
  	  	  	and i even expect them to argue against the concepts described here :) These stuff are already
  	  	  	available in internet, and i have kind of listed my udnerstandings about them, which is subject
  	  	  	to change later.

  	<h3>WHY ?</h3>
  	<p>
  	  	The <a href="./infrastructure.html">preluding post</a> on commons communication infrastructure
  	  	explains why communication infrastructure shall be driven by collaborative culture, owned by
  	  	the grass roots network rather than a centralized control. One cannot deny that a centralized
  	  	system has to follow a commonly agreed constitution, and transparent governance practice for
  	  	the welfare of the people - atleast in principle. Even with initial deterministic neutral and
  	  	progressive intentions, the system may emerge as a subjugative power, in order to preserve its
  	  	designed structure. We have to observe, that atleast in a democratic society, even when the initial
  	  	intentions are progressive, the reality indicate more authoritarian behavior of the governments
  	  	functioning in the democracy.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	By principle, every democracy and its constitution calls people action to protect it from any subjugative
  	  	amendments, so that in future, the constitution will protect the people from subjugation.
  	</p>

  	<p class="content-blockquote">
  	  	The strength of the Constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it. <br>
  	  	Only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional
  	  	rights secure.
  	  	<br>
  	  	<br>
  	  	<i><b>- Albert Einstein</b></i>
  	</p>

	<p>
	  	People in democracy has the right to practice <b>Civil Disobedience</b> (CD) against unjust laws, subjugation,
	  	opression and unjust policies.  CD does not violate constitution, even when one claims so. One thing is clear,
	  	even in a enshrined centralized living document like a constitution, requires peoples action to often reset the
	  	subjugative or tyrannical powers, when the situation goes out of order. People in democracy often do practice
	  	disobedience only when the situation is lot worse than they originally thought. By the way, both constitution
	  	and the practice of civil disobedience cries for critical thinking populace.
	</p>

  	  	<figcaption><b><i>fig.1.</i> Reduced view of interaction between Civil-disobedience, Constitution & Governance </b></figcaption>
  	</figure>

  	<p>
  	  	The reason for delay of action, might be either synthesized by the system or because of the nature of people.
  	  	However, present day communication infrastructures filled with centralized social networks have become a
  	  	good democratic tool to enlighten people with information, evidence, uprise organization, etc... When people
  	  	are seperated by emphasizing the difference, communication infrastructures paves the way to bridge them to a
  	  	common platform which is not possible to do in day to day life style.
  	</p>

	<p>
	  	<b>One can see this strategy as criticizing and controlling centralized beast using another centralized beast.</b>
	  	Democracy literally has no meaning without civil disobedience. And when the governance, constitutional
	  	institutions of a country do not adapt itself to the people's growth in terms of their expectations in
	  	public services, and their quality, then the pressure constantly builds up which often communicated to
	  	the governments through civil disobedience. On the other hand, one can also view this cycles of pressure
	  	and uprise pattern as a pressure relief cycle in a closed tank.
	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	In a representative democracy, we do not seem to act to change the fundamental flow that lurks within the
  	  	design of the system, and instead both the people, & the government seems to play the pressure relief
  	  	dance. Only the amplitude and frequency seems to vary from time to time.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	<li><b>FLAW 1:</b> Representation significantly reduces or dilutes the civic participation</li>
  	  	  	<li><b>FLAW 2:</b> Governance seeks subservient people to make the system work with ease</li>
  	  	  	<li><b>FLAW 3:</b> What is purpose of Education infrastructures, when it failed to mentor progression</li>
  	  	  	<li><b>FLAW 4:</b> Corruption clearly indicates secrecy, nexus & loss of transparency & accountability</li>
  	  	  	<li><b>FLAW 5:</b> Governance seems to transform humans as mechanized resources by placing them in loops</li>
  	  	</ul>
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	One can realize that in such a democratic society, flaws, uprise actions, pressure reliefs, are all intertwined
  	  	with each other constituting the process of democracy. This is ok, when the scale of people is less, easy to
  	  	manage etc., but when the density of people is large, and with more ignorant and subservient people in the
  	  	population, governance infrastructure struggles to implement plans and services. Functioning of daily execution
  	  	of bureaucracy becomes primary importance, and considered as a measure of stability. This situation automatically
  	  	places the people, representatives, constitution, governance, in a mere <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy">plutocratic</a>
  	  	or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy">aristocratic</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy">monarchic</a> society
  	  	taking their own places.
  	</p>

  	<h3>SOLUTION ???</h3>
  	<p>
  	  	<b>Slow but possible solution :</b> Why can't people be advised to stay calm and maintain silence, to be patient,
  	  	do their daily assigned job for daily wages, until the government take care of the people so that we can collectively
  	  	transform ourselves to a highly advanced, efficient, superpower, so that in the future we can provide a peaceful
  	  	utopian life ! By the way while doing that, to make the life entertaining we shall go kick ass others, wage wars,
  	  	& have fun.. :)
	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	<b>Why not a quick solution :</b> Shall we kill people to make the populace less through some efficient patriotic
  	  	strategy ? or by having a cruel leader who kills poor for pleasure ? I assume those who read this, is not of that
  	  	nature, and so what will be the solution which is actually implementable ?
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	<b>Actual solution might be :</b> Why shall not civilians actively participate in democracy by beginning to use
  	  	technologies, tools, ideas that are peer produced, open, transparent, free to share, peer reviewed ? Why shall
  	  	not we participate in governance by democratizing it more and more through active observation by exercising
  	  	transparency and accountability from the infrastructures. If we can act so much using centralized communication
  	  	infrastructures what will be potential of a fully auditable grassroots based communication platform, that
  	  	completely seals the information and digital divide wherever possible in a more symbiotic and organic way !
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	For those who are new to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_audit">Social Auditing</a> <b>(SA)</b>,
  	  	do read about it, and the associated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Information_Act,_2005">RTI</a>,
  	  	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rural_Employment_Guarantee_Act,_2005">MNREGA</a> acts & civil
  	  	organizations. One shall realize how civil society organizations have played key role in uderstanding the acts,
  	  	and using them to retract order in the governance. This made few things clear: people's organization and action
  	  	plan using critical civil participation, exercising available laws, to curb ill effects and causes - did worked.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	Similarly there are many other innovative ways that varies upon the scenario and the country, which we shall
  	  	have to collect about, research which might yield a proper collaborative systems approach for problem solving,
  	  	that are actually tried and working even when they are slower in some situations.
  	</p>

  	<h3>Do We have a independent communication infrastructure ?</h3>
  	<p>
		OK, now with the proof of participation in action works, how shall it be propagated to people all over the
  	  	country ? Well, use the existing communication platforms & infrastructure. We shall share the information,
  	  	explain the situation in detail & how it will affect directly & indirectly even when when it first does not
  	  	seem to be related and connected. This method is nothing but, <b>word of mouth communication</b> in steroids....
  	  	:D.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	We humans tend to use our reasoning, when we become confused. When a individual get confused from information
  	  	overload by a number of threads a communication platform offers and usually pesters with their normative thought
  	  	process, we seek for better explanation through the communication platform itself or in the real world possibly
  	  	from whom we consider as socially aware and educated. Once a critical thought is hooked, then it becomes easy to compare
  	  	the decisions reached by the reasoning ability with the influx of information and reject the false propaganda.
  	  	When this happens, the individual goes on and shares the experience along with information and exaggeration through
  	  	the friends and relation circles publicly.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	When this happens for every second, from part of the population that are connected to a communication platform like
  	  	internet, several innovative stuff like humours, memes emerge and creates pressure for the respective government,
  	  	institution, establishment to take necessary. This action in reality has a significant emotional psychology attached
  	  	to it, and it is the very underpinning reason that motivates one to share rational and critical information about a
  	  	issue. Thus one's emotional quotient serves as the carrier of information. However, nulling the emotional biases,
  	  	will be based on the concentration and constant refreshment of rational information and critical thought expressed and
  	  	propagated through the medium.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	<b>Think about it :</b> What will happen if these centralized communication infrastructure in internet are shutdown
  	  	by a subjugative authority either locally, globally ? We all will be suddenly disconnected even when we have hard lines
  	  	connected with the ISP's which are themselves again connected to the backbones, and so on... For the past 2 years,
  	  	<b>Sarath</b> from <a href="http://sflc.in/">SFLC.in</a> has contributed in observing <a href="https://gitlab.com/sflcin/internetshutdowns">
		internet shutdowns</a>, which is a best illustration of what might be possible just in India. Imagine when we people go to
  	  	streets relying on the online communication infrastructure hoping to see more participation, only to realize that our
  	  	requests have not reached them, because of mass/communication communication failure.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	<b>NO GAURANTEE :</b> With governments already tracking us through all possible means, and have setups to kill the
  	  	internet, is it best to continue with the current infrastructure ? While the current centralized social networking
  	  	platforms like facebook, twitter, google plus, whats app, telegram, etc.... do represent silos cannot provide
  	  	transparency and accountability and cannot gaurantee intervention of government authorities to use the data, to track
  	  	or to even kill the hardware lines.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	Since the centralized social networking where most of the people hang around are based on centralized and non transparent
  	  	business model, nobody can question the organizations policies over it. After all, most of us have compromised our
  	  	freedom & liberty for meagre free of cost services & freebies. Partly because such nasty social taboo always present around
  	  	us dictating ... <b>"always buy or subscribe to something which provides something else for free of cost, u dumb fuck !,
		freedom or liberty does not going to provide for hunger, only money and freebies are going to..."</b> I remember neighbors,
  	  	parents, teachers, friends, cinema actors, local counsellors, preaching this shitty advice to me. The epitome of marketing
  	  	techniques and strategies are reached when we have mouth watering advertisements promoting food pornography and lousy ones
  	  	that despise peaceful protests itself.

  	  	<br>
  	  	<br>
  	  	The point is : <b>Social Audit</b> levels to <b>ZERO (0)</b> in such situation, which is the current scenario.
  	</p>

  	<h3>What does <b>S</b>ocial <b>A</b>udit has to do with Communication ?</h3>
  	<p>
  	  	Let us for now consider that the grassroots communication systems are emerging, where people are provided with open,
  	  	self hosting, self reliable technologies, which are constantly peer reviewed and updated for better performance, personal
  	  	security and so on.... Literally say, the technological problems are being addressed and soon might be solved.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	<b>Even theoretically</b> and with thought experiments one can easily deduce the problem of regulation. How would the network
  	  	infrastructure be regulated and free from malicious and chronic attacks if there is no system of regulation in first place.
  	  	It is necessary that the grass roots communication when emerged from the people has to prove its self regulating capability
  	  	to the government, to prevent all of its subjugation oppressing the communication itself. Else even when we are self reliable
  	  	and equipped with self hosting capabilities, in terms of technology the complete system becomes answerable to a central authority
  	  	which requires a deliberation for its own.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	It seems that grass-roots communication infrastructures like <b>Grassroots <u>Radio Mesh Communication</u> Network</b> requires
  	  	significant human participation in the loop with enough technical understanding and extensive critical thought about the
  	  	infrastructure behavior itself. Moreover, with increasing density and spread, it would ask for a commonly agreeable set of
  	  	guidelines... much like a constitution ... Since this is much of an unexplored territory, one has to research and learn how
  	  	internet itself has evolved without any such constitution during the initial periods. All that we know is, internet does not
  	  	have a written constitution, and simultaneously we cannot reject that most of the internet users <b>do care about</b> its presence,
  	  	whatever that reason might be. We can observe that the following properties, whether originally intended or not, have emerged and
  	  	seems to be inspire most in one way or the other :

  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	<li>Liberty</li>
  	  	  	<li>Freedom of Expression</li>
  	  	  	<li>Information Neutrality in the Network</li>
  	  	  	<li>Anonymity enabling fearless participation</li>
  	  	  	<li>Association through Collaboration</li>
  	  	</ul>
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	Who is going to regulate the infrastructure or what is in place to build a mechanism via technology that follows the
  	  	regulation policies ? Since we now have adopted grass roots - direct to people - participative infrastructure, the policies
  	  	seems to be deployable in similar manner. One can easily understand <b>S</b>ocial <b>A</b>uditing when they compare it with
		<b>Safety guides & regulations</b>. Basically, nobody enforces safety on you, but since we know that it is going to cost our
  	  	lives, the fear drives us to follow those simple guidelines that ensures the safety. Here the safety guidelines are specific
  	  	and varies according to the work, situation, place & time. Thus we have to use both of the following potential methods to
  	  	implement the social audit guidelines, whatever that might be...

  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	<li><b>EDUCATION :</b></li>
  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  	<li><h4>Fear :</h4>
  	  	  	  	    <p>
					Losing communication liberty in exchange of few comfortness, have to be practically illustrated,
  	  	  	  	  	by demonstrating the very effect of subjugative control over the ones communication channel. This
  	  	  	  	  	could be practiced with story telling or cultural acts and skids in schools and colleges, to
  	  	  	  	  	demonstrate the overwhelming result of power concentration.
  	  	  	  	    </p>
  	  	  	  	</li>
  	  	  	  	<li><h4>Critical Thinking :</h4>
  	  	  	  	    <p>
  	  	  	  	      	Engaging in active peer to peer discussion, in a local club, community, debating, emulating
  	  	  	  	      	what if ? scenarios of centralized systems of communication, online web services, etc, will help
  	  	  	  	      	the new comers understand the problem in a deeper manner, driving them to understand not only
  	  	  	  	      	the problems of centralization and hierarchy, but also get a better clarity about it through
  	  	  	  	      	reasoning, while caring about grass roots technology in terms of their limitation, advantages,
  	  	  	  	      	policies involved, etc...
  	  	  	  	    </p>
  	  	  	  	</li>
  	  	  	  	<li><h4>Art :</h4>
  	  	  		     <p>
  	  	  		       	People can effectively use their artistic passion and skill to express an alternative
  	  	  		       	thought, criticisms as it was expressed in history. Writing is one form, painting, drama, ...
  	  	  		       	Since i like comics very much, that along with text which is the common form of expressing
  	  	  		       	views, based on some story, one can make a comic story - which is actually better than a
  	  	  		       	lecture video, and equivalent to a skid/drama on a performing stage.
  	  	  		     </p>
  	  	  	  	</li>
  	  	  	  	<li><h4>Local Economy :</h4>
				    <p>
				      	With any of the above methods, importance of local economy, can be emphasized, and how
				      	conventional internet based infrastructures are becoming draconian competetion that does
				      	not cares about the culture based economy, where the economy are based on operational &
				      	functional policies of the underlying financial structures & institutions. This chronic
				      	situation has to be educated from location based economy approach that understands the local
				      	needs instead of international business competitions and embargos.... :)
				    </p>
  	  	  	  	</li>
  	  	  	</ul>
  	  	  	<li><b>TECHNOLOGY :</b>
  	  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	  	Depending upon the technology, protocols used, shall be made intelligent and aware about
  	  	  	  	  	the peer-reviewed social auditing policies. This will then enable the participating
  	  	  	  	  	communication nodes, to automatically participate in sensing the malicious nodes, potentially
  	  	  	  	  	blacklist them, while at the same time not compromising liberty of the respective users.
  	  	  	  	  	With advancements in collaborative development methods, cryptography, & hardware, this seems
  	  	  	  	  	to be promising. Inclusion of technology in terms of policy is much disturbing now, and can
  	  	  	  	  	be potentially be not implemented in the current scenario.
  	  	  	  	</p>
  	  	  	</li>
  	  	</ul>
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	So far it seems, declaring social audit schemes will be dumb even from my personal view points, and thus must be carried
  	  	with a well experienced, educated, researched and criticial thinking council, that accepts participation. Probably a
  	  	constitution might be required, which shall be distributed to all peers as digital documents in semantic way, that enables
  	  	the communication appliance to cross verify its genuiness, act based on it.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	Lot of stuff have to be deliberated around social auditing topic. like :

  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	<li>properties of auditing</li>
  	  	  	<li>peer-review</li>
  	  	  	<li>who can audit</li>
  	  	  	<li>how shall be audited</li>
  	  	  	<li>how will it be helpful in self-regulation</li>
  	  	  	<li>...</li>
  	  	</ul>
  	</p>

  	<p>
  	  	<b>Interested in digital constitution ? we shall discuss about that in another article possibly soon.</b>
