	  <p>Hey there Water drinkers !</p>

	  <p>
	    We all know Water is the elixir of Life. And freshwater is is much more scarce elixir of Life. When there is more
	    living beings in a planet, competition emerges to sustain life that depends on this elixir. With humans in such an
	    ecosystem, known for consuming water from cleaning our ass to making useless beverages - makes the competition much
	    worse. Especially when the raging market for water packed in polyethylene bottles and selling sand that once was a river
	    and lake beds to meet the accelerated urbanization requirements become normative. It turns out humans are their own
	    problems. I mean me too.

	    Well i dont know what i can contribute to solve this problem, apart from being conscious and take part in protests as
	    a usual common citizen would do. But i can do one more thing that feeds my intellectual capacity as well as letting
	    myself understand the problem from a scientific but associated perspective. With that intention & existing know how of
	    handling GIS data, tools, some theory & internet i think i can do something about it. <mark>But why River in particular ?</mark>
	    I view common water bodies as (rivers, acquifiers, lakes, ponds, tanks) as the common representator of water collection,
	    flow, banking, and contributor of complex ecosystems which in turn contribute to other ecosystems. Its <mark>flow</mark> completes the
	    natural water/hydrological cycle.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Liking the power of Free Software tools contributed by awesome developers, students, researchers all over the world is
	    just one thing. Doing stuff using it is completely a new experience. It is definetely a interesting and addictive
	    task. It is like having a katana collaboratively made by swordsmiths trained by good martial art mentors. If i am not
	    good making katana, i shall learn to use it. Since now i can access the information how it is made and why it is made
	    so, it will help in slashing through realworld problems and issues. One has to know how to use it & when to use it.

	    Being conscious and aware about the problems surrounding us are vital, and getting to know about the
	    geographical nature & environment that sustains us is much more essential. It is the material & immaterial
	    fabric that connects us. Exploring the topography around ones location, aided with the modern FOSS tools,
	    is not equivalent to what one shall enjoy in taking a magnetic compass, finely scaled map, trekking, taking
	    notes, surveying, collecting data from nature, recording nature's awe but will surely reduce the labour
	    that loads our intellectual work, so that we can use it wisely for craftsman ship embedded in the work.
	    This is what i have tried to attempt in the <a href="../../../../content/category/hackwork/try-terrain/try-terrain.html">earlier article</a>, to start with.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Starting from the common GIS workflow again guides one to keep the process simple and explainable. In this
	    attempt we are trying to look at the river of interest and see how come FOSS based tools, libraries, Open
	    data, Open Access research papers, & internet will help us explore.

	  <p>
	    Learning hydrological view of nearby Water bodies (ex: River) has sure lead the exploration to all other overlapping
	    transdisciplinary fields. It is a wonderful way of learning geo-sciences that also lets one constantly be aware about
	    the socio-economic influence it always has in human history. So, before doing something with the tools that provides
	    the power, one has to know the theoretical understanding of what <a href="http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Hydrology">hydrology</a> mean, how it is related to fundamental
	    topography and how will it water collection, flow, & storage, until it confluences to either the ocean or
	    sinks to a land locked lake/pond. 
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Its wise to remember, that both terrain study and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrology">hydrological</a> study of a
	    region is carried out using calibrated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying">survey</a> instruments, trained workforce
	    constituting managers, researchers, scientists, surveyors, auditing officials, etc. This attempt is to see how far we can go with
	    Open data, FOSS tools & Open Access Research. Labour put into such tedious task of collecting data representing "ground truth" &
	    disseminating data for further use must be thanked. It is a well known fact, that geospatial science has always respected, adapted
	    and contributed for Open systems & standards.

	    Hydrology, as far as i understand constitutes knowing about several kind of data, and related knowledge about it.
	    Only then one can understand how labouriously collected can be put together to make sense of it. Also from a
	    community of individuals perspective, working on how to extract useful, intutively interpretative & interactive
	    information about the local region is of fundamental importance. As the Region is now bounded it requires relatively
	    very less computing requirements, and when exceeds a individuals power, communities support in handling the load
	    & making the work very feasible and useful at the end.

	    Topography of a region decides the hydrological effects. Learning about one have lead to learning about the other.
	    Understanding about the information dependence lets us see how terrain contribute to formation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin">catchment basins</a>.
	    With the availability of open data and internet, one can analyze and visualize topography from the Terrain data
	    available in public domain. Furthermore, access to Spectral remote sensing data, and their derived indices (water,
	    vegetation, turbidity, ...) help visualize how the flow of water & its storage form the hydrology throughout its
	    presence. Then one could see clearly how the fundamental topographical & hydrological nature of a region influences
	    the cultural & socio-economic conditions.

		  Knowing surface/terrain information and generating topographic details from it for the selected region, based
		  on administrative boundary will be the most intuitive way to focus the scope of play and analysis. When
		  the region of interest, cannot be confined within a specific administrative boundary, one may have to
		  widen the scope of interest to more than one geographical regions, spanning neighbouring villages or
		  districts or counties or states or countries. This makes the boundary information to be accurate and
		  satisfactory for included administrative regions. Care needs to be taken that such an attempt must not
		  trigger any boundary related issues while publishing.
		</p>

		<p>
		  <mark>But Why ?</mark> In the case of hydrological study, for instance a river, which naturally provides
		  resources for more than an administrative region is an undeniable common and shared resource. In such cases
		  starting from topographic analysis to extracting hydrological and socio-economic or cultural information
		  needs to include plurality of inter-boundary features. Every step of the study & analysis must be underpinned
		  with scientific and engineering principles & practices.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Since, i have already tried understanding terrain and extrating topographic information associated with it,
		  in an <a href="../../../../content/category/hackwork/try-terrain/try-terrain.html">earlier article</a>, as
		  in the above picture. It would be better to further see how it helps in associating with hydrological understanding.
		  Also, since my interest is now aligned with studying and analysing hydrology of south indian river <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palar_River">Palar</a>.
		  Thus now, the region of interest, must span the <u>districts in each of the 3 states</u>, through out which Palar flows:

		  <ul>
		    <li>Karnataka</li>
		    <li>Andhra Pradesh</li>
		    <li>TamilNadu</li>
