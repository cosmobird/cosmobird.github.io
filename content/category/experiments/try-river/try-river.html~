	  <p>Hey there Water drinkers !</p>

	  <p>
	    We all know Water is the elixir of Life. And freshwater is is much more scarce elixir of Life. When there is more
	    living beings in a planet, competition emerges to sustain life that depends on this elixir. With humans in such an
	    ecosystem, known for consuming water from cleaning our ass to making useless beverages - makes the competition much
	    worse. Especially when the raging market for water packed in polyethylene bottles and selling sand that once was a river
	    and lake beds to meet the accelerated urbanization requirements become normative. It turns out humans are their own
	    problems. I mean me too.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Well i dont know what i can contribute to solve this problem, apart from being conscious and take part in protests as
	    a usual common citizen would do. But i can do one more thing that feeds my intellectual capacity as well as letting
	    myself understand the problem from a different but associated perspective. With that intention & existing know how of
	    handling GIS data, tools, some theory, internet i think i can do something about it.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    Liking the power of Free Software tools contributed by awesome developers, students, researchers all over the world is
	    just one thing. Doing stuff using it is completely a new experience. It is definetely a interesting and addictive
	    task. It is like having a katana collaboratively made by swordsmiths trained by good martial art mentor. If i am not
	    good making katana, i shall learn to use it. It might help in slashing through realworld problems and issues. One has
	    to know how to use it & when to use it.

	  <p>
	    My Locality - the TamilNadu state, India is very well known for its River disputes with its neighbouring states. This
	    has become part of our lives. I do not know who to blame about it. May be every caring empathizing citizen taking responsibility
	    would help solve the problem. However, i would try to keep focus on my beloved neighbour hood river Palar situated very
	    near to my village and home. I believe it would help me learn about rivers, and the socio-economic-political issues that
	    underpin such essential natural resource.
