	We all have experienced enjoying atleast one eclipse in our life time. It is also emotionally rewarding for some.
	Every culture seems to have some kind of interpretation to it. However, for those who dared to question the normative
	rules, such astronomical events happening within Earth's vicinity help wonder about the possible reasons behind
	it. Scientific explanation in Astronomy so far has provided with tremendous amount of information that help realize
	the beautiful complexity behind it. After getting to know it, i personally realized how fortunate humanity is in time,
	to experience such awesome natural events.
      </p>

      <p>
	It has also helped researchers, eclipse chasers, artists, by revealing the astronomical facts which apparently not
	visible or detectable without eclipse. At first, in fact we are being flattered by the shadows of one rock on another.
	The fact seems simple. But theorizing and proving the exact mechanisms are really really difficult. It simply takes
	time. We need to observe painstakingly. Some desperate researcher has to keep their eye glued to the telescopes in order
	to get reliable data to compile the observation.
      </p>

      <p>
	Since eclipses are phenomena that occurs when one enoromous rock in space casts shadow on nearby shadow for a brief
	duration, we are more interested in occultations that happens between star - Sun, planet Earth & its natural satellite Moon.
	I am not going into much details as like a wikipedia article or any other research institute could offer. I consider
	this writing as my view and learning from my peers <u>ArunIssac & Surender</u>. Eventhough eclipse is a pretty event, it is
	ArunIssac who have actually discussed with me about writing a interactive application that might probably help people
	to look into about eclipse and learn it from there. This stumbled upon while we were searching for personally entycing
	projects and seems to be a perfect candidate. Eventhough i do not know much of programming, i have immediately accepted to
	contribute for it.

      <p>
	Several astronomers constantly study, look & observe several occultation events happening by scoping several planets
	from different observatories and artificial satellites, there is still much can be learned from the solar and lunar eclipses
	that we are fascinated with so much. Since most celestial bodies are governed by same natural laws that govern our local
	planets, whatever one learns about it, will eventually help to learn further and be wise in space exploration.
