    We Started from Pondicherry by evening 5:30 PM and got trapped in the public transport buses setting our journey destination to Calicut. This is a shore city to shore city journey. Romantacizing it, i understood that we are travelling from a shore where sunrise is common to a shore & mountanious forest where sunset is common. I tried to read a significant part of <b>Roads to Freedom by Bertrand Russel</b>. I could never go more that a few pages during the travel. Most of the time what usually boys would discuss in travel. Surprisingly significant part of the discussion was about what are we actually trying as a cooperative, and whether we are in right path at both principal and pragmatic level. Is it ok to expect complete success of the intiative ... and such stuff. Plainly the discussions are at an abstract level but intellectually charged more often where our emotional bonding floats to the surface, further reinforcing our trust based relationship based on a common goal.

  <h3>Stop 0 : Puducherry</h3>
  <p>
    I weared a shorts, and i could feel heat, humidity, even when plenty of air flowing through. But our midnight talks and discussions in the bus, that obviously disturbed the neighbour passengers helped me to forget about the mild dampness in my skin. We have travelled through beautiful rivers of Pondicherry surrounded by few flamboyant mangroves, and within 2 hours reached Cuddalore, where the discussion has been initiated by someone regarding love life and alternative relationship models. Unfortunately, we didn't took any photos as the conservations are kind of seriously fun and filled with constant buzz from the bus engine.

  <h3>Stop 1 : Salem</h3>

  <p>
    While the bus came to a Hotel stop near Salem we ate lot of Idli's, Idiyappam's, Dosas & some Chola Puri's and packed ourselves with lot of eatables for the remaining hours of bus travel. Prasanna, one of our Cooprade have funnily explained in detail how would our stool shape and colour based on the eatable we planned to consume during the journey. We also had the discussion will the bus conductor allow us to stop the bus at some arbitrary place IF someone had real disposal urgency !. Almost all the eatables we bought were never consumed based on the imagined situations in each of our minds, where the suffering person would be thyself. Ha ha ha... LOL. I did imagined myself asking for a emergency stop. By this time, our OSM'er cooprade Kamalavelan, took out his phone and started tracing out GPX tracks using OSMAnd application which i envied as i could not do it - currently being a luddite. Cooprade Ragulkanth sitting next to me was asking me several real questions about my reality, capacity, experience, learning, threshold points, tragedy of commons, etc.. which i think i have answered without any untruth. And as always we have teased our Cooprade Maniraj, for his cuteness and endurance to peer pressure. He is learning all things cooperative and sometimes i personally reach my threshold of temper, but that trains me how to interact with people and empathize them  more. Even when i break, it helps me to avoid the conditions of tragedy of commons because of emotional charges and reservations that might sprout in my mind - a Bayesian approach.

  <h3>Stop 2 : Coimbatore</h3>

    Time: almost 1:15 AM. This is where we all woke up from few hours of sleep. My eyes are burning. I badly needed water. Searched for it and with hesitation, asked gigantic looking shopkeeper for water. With his bulky red eyes, he pointed his huge hand to a haunted damp place where i could see shines from dripping drops. Meanwhile, cooprades went on to buy nasty packaged flavoured juice packets. This has tempted me and after having water in a bottle, came back to them and bought a juice for me too. Hell, its not good and its a bad decision. It is also costlier. Then back to bus and felt the heat wave generated within the bus from the gas bombs released due to food intake from earlier stopping from all passengers in the bus. I could literally feel the heat and smell. Yet nobody is going to even talk about it, as we are all part of the sin. LOL. Still i had fun thinking earlier conversations. Tips: Do not eat much in your travel, especially if you have bowel movement problems. I accidentally (more like wantedly.. duh ) happen to eat a bun and jam preserved by Prasanna, which resulted in burps after burps for every road bumps and turnings with the bus. It sounded like i was signaling every bump and turnings the bus had to go. It is completely a bad decision. Yet i tried to sleep. Cooprades already went to sleep some with even "sound" sleep. Jealous came to my face.

  <h3>Stop 3 : Kozhikode</h3>

    Time : by 4:45 AM. We somehow reached Calicut, without knowing that the bus has to go via IIM Calicut. I didn't had any experience with bus travel to Calicut. We are almost 11Km away from the destination. We were at KSRTC main stand. The interesting thing about Calicut city is that it has 3 bus terminus. The near the railway station is what i am more familiar with like 6 years back in time. Immediately i can recognize that the city has changed a lot. Sidewalks become lot better and paved on one hand, and saw huge rise in shopping malls, consumer good shops on the other hand. Looks like neo-liberal economy has also influenced this malabar city heavily. Fortunately many Co-op societies still sustain and many have been modernized too. On the whole, the feeling is warm. But we still have long way to reach. Really i was confused about the mind map i had about the city. It felt mainly strange for me. Visual interpretation became more and more challenging. Soon, from the new bus stand, i came to know that to reach Kunnamangalam, buses will start from Palayam bus stand. Immediately with the help of OSM, while simultaneously marking unavailable POI's some of our cooprades helped in guiding our way towards Palayam. It was almost 5:30 AM. We walked and walked and walked, and we had to see the beautiful market road with its buzzing early morning activity managing logistics, storage and dispatch. Now Calicut looked lively and brisk, waking up from its sleep. With huge load of tiredness we reached Palayam. I had to go ask for the buses and we waited for the bus until 6:15 AM when we got a bus, and with beautiful 90's Tamil songs played we reached IIM Calicut.

  <h3>Stop 4 : IIM Kozhikode</h3>

    IIM looked simple and humble, and for how many time i dont know, called Abinandh, wonderful organizer from ULTS, for the Coopathon has guided us to reach the venue. After initial checking in the gate security, all 6 of us has been allowed to pass through. No auto rickshaws were available and we cooprades with our raging blood instantly agreed to walk. Security personnel encouraged its just a morning walk. Surprisingly we had to see a section of the land was alloted for RSS bakths. STRANGE for us. OK. The road started to become steeper and steeper. Bypassers in autorickshaws(i still dont know where they got served) and scooters gawked at us with strange look. May be, because we all weared 3/4ths and trousers, smell and look. We took some rest and had some selfies in the way. IIM had this steps connecting the hairpin roads, which we bypassed easily. Now i could understand why i heared a slight smile in Abinandh's voice. :D. But i like the mini-trek experience. By this time all of us were wet with sweat. We smelled and decided to go directly land in our rooms.
