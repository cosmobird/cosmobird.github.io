			<h3>→ Morning Session</h3>
			<p>
				I was helping Prasanna from FSHM & <a href="https://pymeshnet.gitlab.io/">PyMesh</a> in organizing his session, bringing up the router, etc... stuff,
	  	  	  	to demonstrate to the attendees a good idea about the <b>commons-infrastructure</b> & grass-roots
	  	  	  	oriented mesh networks. The session is organized to share the stage equally for introducing
	  	  	  	about <a href="https://www.freedomboxfoundation.org/">FreedomBox</a> and the experimentations <b>Bhuvan Krishna</b> and his Hardware/Software
	  	  	  	community in <b>Swecha</b> doing with it. The goal of the shared introduction is to trigger
	  	  	  	an alternative thought process by igniting about the current infrastructure that connects us, and
	  	  	  	make them understand how fragile it is.
	  	  	</p>

			<p>
			  	However, the FreedomBox, session took much time than anticipated, as it has to be explained
			  	properly for all the attendees, and the interesting experimentations, successess, failures they
			  	had with it, while deploying in a village, etc... People seem to understand atleast a little
			  	bit about where FreedomBox is attacking the problem to solve the <b>Man in the middle</b>, as
			  	well as Commons-infrastructure approach to solve the same problem. What i have learned is that,
			  	both the vector is necessary and complement each other essentially. For example, project like
			  	FreedomBox, could run overlay web services that enable people communicate with their present
			  	knowledge - respecting <b>empathy</b>, creating a social mobilization one at a time, creating
			  	an emergent awareness socially.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	Whereas, we hacktivists, who cannot hold our horses, to try new stuff and bang our heads with
			  	problems and philosophies, have decided to try FreedomBox style and then moved to a Radio-Mesh,
			  	in other words, community networks where the network architecutre and topology will primarily
			  	be decentralized/federated, that essentially requires commons based peer production and social
			  	auditing in the long run, requiring people who could understand the fundamental functional nature
			  	- which is what we believe FreedomBox like projects will enable in near future.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	With more and more democratic uprising, people will ask and require more and more independent,
			  	disaster/delay tolerant networking infrastructure - while affordable by all. This is a alternative
			  	path towards <b>Communication is not luxury, not even utility, but a necessity</b>. The potential
			  	in Indian scenario is just now starting and lot of cracks, emptiness, grey areas needs to be filled
			  	by interested and skilled people.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	The session, ended smoothly with queries raising about hidden centralization in decentralized networks,
			  	about hardware used in FreedomBox, etc... which we were expecting from the audience. Prasanna & Bhuvan
			  	have optimally answered the questions they could answer, and with hunger, everybody were eager to have
			  	lunch.... :D.
			</p>

			<h3>→ Afternoon Session</h3>
			<p>
				I and some of my friends/peers attended <b>Smart Cities</b> session handled by <b>Francesca Bria</b> &
			  	<b>Evgeny Morozov</b>. I was waiting for their opinion and Barcelonas experience in having grass-roots
			  	strategy, contribution towards building real smart cities that embraced participation of citizens. One best
			  	example would be consulting <a href="https://guifi.net/en/">Guifi</a> & <a href="http://www.freifunk.net/">Freifunk</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	Sicne, i have been working in GIS, where lot of international, grass-roots collaborative effort similar to
			  	Wikipedia is happening - especially in Open Street Maps, i know that there is a best opportunity that
			  	Union of India, and corresponding departments will access those data along with their own surveys to build
			  	Smart cities that they invasion. In this case, there is a good chance that the data could be used
			  	unethically for panopticon surveillance atleast theoretically... Here people are contemplating GIS using
			  	GIS information regulation bill, where as around the world, all major public funded research institutions
			  	have been releasing data to the public under public domain, and using public participation from city planning
			  	to surveying, to forest fire mitigation, and disaster recovery. On the other hand, our smart cities, seems
			  	to be filled with surveillance cameras in a panopticon fashion, as <b>one nation under CCTV</b>, even before
			  	taking eradicating actions against poverty - which is the true cause of social unrest, and emergence of
			  	anti-social elements.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	Definetely, the government here does not seem to solve the real problems by facing the truth, instead
			  	uses Technology as a blanket to paste a membrane in front of people, literlly fooling them and make
			  	believe using voluntarily mandatory & economic push strategies as the path towards development.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	My question to her was, what are all the strategies people in Catalonia to make their governance enable
			  	what people need and embrace the participation eventually leading to a effective social auditing system
			  	by culture. Her long answer, is that, they initially faced lot political depressions and changes which
			  	they have to go through and make it work in order to make use of technology properly - which is what
			  	i was expecting. And that further made peers in the hall, accept and encourage such points, which have
			  	sowed new seeds in new people influxing into communities - who have initially believed that technology
			  	alone can change everything. After this conversation i have heard people talking about social and political
			  	stands that they need to face with technology in hand. Which is a great improvement, and i believe as one
			  	of the expectations of this conference.
			</p>

			<h3>→ Evening Session</h3>
			<p>
			  	<b>Our Digital Future</b> session was handled by <b>Neville Roy Singham</b>. As usual, he has
			  	expressed his activist side and have shown really good presentation that recorded and reported
			  	statistics on current state of employment and the projected future state, social action,
			  	etc... and so on. However, i personally felt that his talk was more emotionally motivated that
			  	too have created a paranoia among the crowd with <b>fear of losing jobs</b> :D, that actually
			  	made the crowd emotionally attached to this talk.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	you see paranoia, is a great tool, to draw & leverage attention - lights up the senses.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	I kind of felt over honourary in the crowd - even among my peers, toward the speech. However, the
			  	speech is great. It would have been even great, if he has extended his speech on how would it be
			  	when nobody has a job to do and there might be a good chance to pursue whatever they are passionate
			  	and interested in. That would be so faaaawwwking awesome, and would have further raised questions
			  	about critical use of technology - dispersing its usage in all fields possible.
			</p>

			<h3>→ Cultural</h3>
			<p>
				Third day, we were enjoying melodical songs from carnatic origins, and the orchestration initiated
			  	with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirukku%E1%B9%9Ba%E1%B8%B7">Thirukkural</a>
		  	        <a href="http://www.thefullwiki.org/Thirukkural">( திருக்குறள் )</a>, continued to sing great inspirational
			  	and melody songs from atleast 5 different language which i could recognize the difference. Its truly a awesome
			  	and diversified expereince. I could still hum something that caught my attention, which i cannot express
			  	in words... or even with my vocals.... dont ask me to do that.... With the lack of words to express,
			  	i am not going to say anything further.... :D
			</p>

			<p>
			  	After the completion and great send off for the carnatic orchestration, folks filed 100 years of Tamil
			  	Cinema, which is a great video collection of Movie clips of famous scenes, put together by Raj Video
			  	Visions. People enjoyed it watching and could really witness how the cinema over here has emerged and
			  	evolved with lot of variations, updates.... etc... But sadly with lack of time and strict regulations,
			  	the movie was abruptly stopped and we disbanded back to our hostels discussing stuff which we left
			  	last night.

	  <p><h3>WHY THE HELL AM I USING A CENTRALIZED COMMENTING SYSTEM ?</h3></p>
	  <p>
	  	Eventhough i am philosophically oriented, inclined and aligned to, grassroots, self hosting, decentralized/federated communication
	  	& web services,to reach maximal audience i have to undergo serious compromises to my critical self and enable centralized services
	  	like disqus which we shall be used for criticizing and discussing about the topic specific to this article.... :). I believe we are
	  	all in transition towards a more meshed, federated & socially auditable internet and in the mean time, i had to make such compromises
	  	to reach humans out there... !

	    	In near future i have planned to learn about completely self reliable and self hosted grassroots communication services. Only then
	    	i can live upto my thoughts. Until then, i would have to undergo such compromises that puts me in a awkward situation.
