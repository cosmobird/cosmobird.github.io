  	  	      	<p><h3>DAY 1 - RESONATION & WORKSHOPS :</h3></p>

  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	Prasanna and other backend volunteers sleep deprieved, were still organizing stuff on accomodation,
	  	  	  	and hall arrangement for workshops. I managed to escape the chaos, and took some sleep by 2:00 A.M.
	  	  	  	and woke early to find that our hostel rooms either had a bad bathroom doors or at best does not have
	  	  	  	one.... :). <b><i>Talk to me about privacy.....</i></b>
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<h3>→ Before Session</h3>
  	  	  	<p>
				Aaaahhh.... Shit... i have to go to lu... and then i decided to convince myself to control my
  	  	  	  	natural instincts using heavy cognitive - neural - emotional dispersion - mechanisms. Then i remembered
  	  	  	  	that the main hall where we were working last night had awesome toilets, and decided to release my controls
  	  	  	  	& dams over there.... you should have seen my face bursting with emotions in between travel time.... from
  	  	  	  	hostel to the main hall - during which the watch man in the hostel have stopped me requesting some bags
  	  	  	  	for him assuming that i am the incharge of the whole guys staying in hostel. U know.. with my pressure
  	  	  	  	building up my behind, and in the verge of breaking, i have accepted his assumption and never explained him
  	  	  	  	that i was just one of other volunteers, and in turn assured him give him one - which i have never
  	  	  	  	fulfilled.... ;D
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	... i bet every volunteer who stayed in the hostel would have undergone such control
  	  	  	  	mechanism atleast once.... :D
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<h3>→ During Session</h3>
  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Here comes the next big wave for me: Even after workshop session started, my allocated hall is still
  	  	  	  	empty. After arranging necessary resources like benches, projectors and stuff, ... then came the
  	  	  	  	spot registered students from a nearby college... I started as usual discussing and getting to know them.
  	  	  	  	They were just pre-final engineering students of E.C.E. I could easily handle students.
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Now enters a peer of elderly age who have worked in Kerala Agricultural University in GIS associated
  	  	  	  	with vegetation for 15+ years.... I bet no other workshops would have seen a participating peer of this
  	  	  	  	diversity. What shall i do now....
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Now, the second wave of people who of Geography professors teaching GIS, cartography, and were using
  	  	  	  	FOSS tools extensively in their life. Whereas, my GIS experience is just 3+ years and everything i learned
  	  	  	  	is sporadic and self taught in the free time i got. Although i believed my fundas are stronger, i thought
  	  	  	  	i could not even entertain them... and with continuous flow of students from nowehere the nearly empty
  	  	  	  	hall was filling and i had to restart everything often to the incoming people.
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Now i am literally confused where to start, on one side, we have got students who never opens their mouth
  	  	  	  	for any stuff i queried about.... on the other hand we've got experienced GIS experts... that is one hell of
  	  	  	  	a bandwidth range which i need time to think of... Have u ever seen <b>Dexter's laboratory ?</b>, in one of
  	  	  	  	the episondes, his brain would go haywire with his work pressure... i nearly felt like that. With overflowing
  	  	  	  	of GIS information which i had to cramp the 4 day content and provide it in one day and need to handle the
  	  	  	  	session... i was jumping between topics so wildly....
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Then came to my help, geography professors, who initiated a interactive session that helped relieve
  	  	  	  	my pressure and he took almost the whole morning session.... I learned a little bit of art of teching from him
  	  	  	  	;).... Had a nice little talk and gone for lunch. After lunch we assembled again and i have
  	  	  	  	demonstrated as much stuff as possible, and have infused usage of FOSS, tools, philosophies, etc wherever
  	  	  	  	possible - which have actually pressed me to write a blog post about the demonstration itself, so that
  	  	  	  	those who like to learn about it, can <u><a href="../../../../content/category/hackwork/try-terrain/try-terrain.html">try</a></u>
  	  	  	  	it in their home.
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<h3>→ After Session</h3>

  	  	  	<p>
				Had nice dinner, physically tired, and then met my peer (Tamil Wikipedian & Entrepreneur).... <b><i>Lenin</i></b>,
  	  	  	  	master in Nano-Science officially, as usual we spoke about a lot on day to day stuff, and deep philosophical
  	  	  	  	shit too.  Particularly i like the language <b>+</b> slang of Lenin, the way he expresses stuff is common man and
  	  	  	  	simple. He is literally awesome as he is one of the key volunteer who have arranged for printing banner, drawing
  	  	  	  	logos, etc... even during pressing grave family situations. These men are the inspirors who made other volunteers
  	  	  	  	do the volunteering work so awesomely. During all discussions, we are accompanied by <b><i>Venkatesh</i></b> from
  	  	  	  	FSFTN - with all this interesting thoughts and intervention strategies.... that led me and Venkatesh to have a good
  	  	  	  	long talk.. :D
  	  	  	</p>
