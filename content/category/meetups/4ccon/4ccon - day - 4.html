	  	  	  	Since i am not a official member of any of the organization taking part in the conference, i must
	  	  		not put down my views about their meetings and practice. However, as a viewer, i found a significant
	  	  	  	part of democratic practice in all the organization.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	People, know me as a man who does not uses a "smart phone". Now in the very last day, i have successfully
			  	lost my phone that transformed/promoted me from <b>near luddite</b> to <b>real luddite</b> state. I searched
			  	for it in all possible places and still i cannot find it. All contacts gone... <i>poooofff</i> :D. However,
			  	i came to now, that some other guy have even lost his laptop. thats really sad. I hope he did not have
			  	any of his vital/research data. I learned how not to search for a phone by the way. Thanks to those
			  	awesome volunteers who helped me search for the phone and spread the news through their internal chat
			  	groups... :)
			</p>
  	  	    </li>
  	  	  </ul>

  	  	  <br></br>

  	  	  <h3>INFORMAL + FRIENDLY DISCUSSIONS</h3>

  	  	  <p>
  	  	    	My well wishers, peers, friends, researchers, geeks, from the communities gave me valuable - life saving
  	  	    	suggestions, which made me think over about myself and my current practice. <b>Shrinivasan</b> advised
  	  	    	me start a company and consult stuff based upon my skill set. People have literally scolded me to write
  	  	    	a blog or have a vlog for years, and i believe i hade this time.. :D. This time i thought i would talk
  	  	    	less and listen more, but situations made me speak with folks around me and sometimes even dominating
  	  	    	derailing myself from the listening mode.
  	  	  </p>

  	  	  <p>
  	  	    	I do found some of my attitudes that are passively dominating which i am working on it. Moreover,
  	  	    	each discussion appended to my cognitive dissonance, which is already stretching itself out of the white
  	  	    	box. I think i could manage dissonance and practicing less and less procrastination than ever.
  	  	  </p>

  	  	  <p>
  	  	    	I know what u are still expecting.... i cannot share those stuff we discussed with u...
  	  	  </p>

  	  	  <h3>WHAT I LEARNED ?</h3>

  	  	  <p>
  	  	    	A loooooooooot. Lot of stuff about technology, techno-politics, information-politics, socio-technical interfaces
  	  	    	and frictions emerging out of it, social mobilization, alternative infrastructures, about design stuff,
  	  	    	about womens participation in technology, net neutrality, aadhaar, UPI, India Stack, journalism, wikipedia,
  	  	    	mesh networks, commons infrastructure, critical civic policy intervention, data commodification, India's economic
  	  	    	condition, demonitization - its usage as a <b>"katana slash"</b> by the government - and got more confident about
  	  	    	my thought process. I have met a lot of elders who have been doing research as their profession, and now pursuing
  	  	    	their love/passion in free software and allied systems. Conversed with people from other states in different
  	  	    	languages like Telugu (i can speak a little and could understand), wherever and whenever possible. Tasted
  	  	    	great and awesome phone by the way.
  	  	  </p>

	  	  	</figure>

  	  	  <p>
  	  	    	Slept relatively more than the volunteers and relatively less than the remaining peers :D. Observed, that still
  	  	    	the communities have to engage a lot more women participation and encourage their influx, to neutralize male
  	  	    	domination. In both the cultural session, i have seen equal pariticpation of male and female artists, where as
  	  	    	in tech. community groups like this, the ratio is not even near to equal. I am pretty sure people are working
  	  	    	towards gender equality in Free Software and similar systems realm. For the past 4 years, atleast, i have seen
  	  	    	a steady raise in women participation, even if it is not as much as male pariticipation. Folks i feel, that
  	  	    	this thing has to be seriously acted upon. Correct me if i am wrong about the view... :). I am still not convinced
  	  	    	for i have missed the <b>Women in Technology</b> session. However, my dear friend, <b>Sohom</b> was
			one of the few men who attended the session. I like to learn from his observation soon... :)
  	  	  </p>

  	  	  <p>
  	  	    	I also found people discussing innovative ways to engage people to increase the participation apart from
  	  	    	conventional forms like starting GLUGS, arranging workshops, organizing camps, etc... which i personally feel a
  	  	    	better step towards propagating the views and philosophy of this great community to a wider public. I also
  	  	    	hope that we shall intervene through more civic participation on policy research and against draconian acts.
  	  	    	We cannot only code and change the system, we have to act physically and critically. One thing i am pretty
  	  	    	sure is that lot of folks who attended this conference, would have a better view of the world they thrive in &
  	  	    	would have realized how invisible laws, policies, systems have influenced their life till now. Those who have
  	  	    	that sparkle mind opening experience, would look far more deeper and wider than ever before.
  	  	  </p>
