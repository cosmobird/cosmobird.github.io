  	  	<p>Hey there <b>!</b></p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLIAMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Hey folks, i am just expressing my view of awesome <a href="https://4ccon.fsmi.in/">4CCON conference</a>
  	  	  	that i experienced by being a part of the conference volunteer and workshop speaker. I neither endorse
  	  	  	nor express any objective view. The following incidents were totally of my fun and stuff that happened
  	  	  	in the national meetup.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	If u cannot tolerate profanity, i humbly ask you to leave this site and go browse something eye candy !
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>INTRO :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	So, being around with communities like FSFTN, FSMK, FSHM atleast for a few years and having a huge
  	  	  	set of awesome peers and friends, i know to a certain extent how these dudes work during a public event
  	  	  	like this. Atleast, i have been part in some other events, which was organized locally in some
  	  	  	districts of TamilNadu, Karnataka. The volunteers who worked in 4CCON, behind the banner designs, who worked
  	  	  	behind catering food, who involved in accomodation of huge volunteer density, who involved in arranging
  	  	  	technical workshops(even in chaos), who took pain in coinvincing university staff that requires tight and
  	  	  	right at the edge planning & execution, who designed & coded the awesome website, who involved in handling
  	  	  	the workshops, most of the other folks who run here and there without ever knowing why they even actually
  	  	  	running and doing things...
  	  	</p>

  	  		</figure>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	and by the way, there are folks like me, who go there, eat food, free load stuff, observe people, involve
  	  	  	in discussion, hang around people, raise questions.... you know doing stuff the humans do in a group... :)
  	  	  	in short we are the psychedelics of the conference, who keep the groups relaxed, tensed, fun, and so on...
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Did i mentioned ? the conference is not only about propagating free/open source software & hardware, policies,
  	  	  	philosophies, practicies, tools & sharing knowledge stuff... this time it has marked a significant step
  	  	  	towards a social progression, through active civic participation & democratic policy intervention which as a
  	  	  	social movement people tirelessly involved since its inception 6 years ago !
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>MY PLANNING :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
			I have registed for the conference to handle a workshop on GIS, to share my learning and experiences,
  	  		workflow with peers who are interested and liked to share similar stuff. I have registed atleast a
  	  		month early. That gave me a pretty much wider bandwidth to think about the workshop, and accomodated
  	  		stuff into a LaTeX based presentation from my notes, block diagrams, screenshots, drawings... u know.
  	  		In the process i assumed that the workshop would be scheduled for 4 days, and so i have been mentally
  	  		preparing and organizing the content and content delivey. (U know assumptions are the seed of all fuckups !)
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
			One fine day, one of the organizer, from FSFTN telephoned me regarding something which i dont remember about, and in
  	  	  	the conversation, he informed that the workshop will all be held in one day...! That is all, enough for
  	  	  	me to put my congnition regarding conference in jeopardy.... and have decided to cramp all the 70+ slides
  	  	  	within a day.... ! Lets see how it goes....
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Basically my planning was resetted and i have to go adhoc !, which will be interesting to handle.... :D
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>ME TRAVELLING :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	This is during while almost all youth and people were confused about, thinking, contemplating, critically processing
  	  	  	their decisions, emotionally acting, democratically protesting for <b>Jallikattu</b>. Just a day or two before
  	  	  	starting my journey for the cornference, two delegates from FSMK were travelling from Bangalore, to Chennai, by
  	  	  	train via Katpadi, which is when political intervention resulted in their train held up without any
  	  	  	further announcement. One of my friend telephoned me, when i fortunately picked and asked me to help them out...
		</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Even with all commotion happening in chennai, people from other districts, other states have accumulated in
  	  	  	Chennai, and volunteering seriously for atleast a month afaik.

  	  	    	 <figure>
	  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/pictures/meetup-4ccon/volunteers-in-fsftn-office.jpg" alt="volunteers-in-fsftn">
	  	  	  	<figcaption><b>some of the core volunteers in FSFTN office, Chennai</b></figcaption>
  	  		</figure>

  	  	    	It is a photo pic, showing some of the core volunteers discussing about the even management stuff.... :)
  	  	    	Don't even think... i was not there when this happened...
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	We had good time, during their stay over in my home... and helped them travel to Chennai next day morning via bus.
  	  	  	Then comes my turn, and after finishing some of the works in home, and taking leave from my home duty, i travelled
  	  	  	to Chennai from Vellore 25th morning, helped arranging some stuff, getting to know new people, starting having fun,
  	  	  	travelled via train to the station along with other coooool peers and finally reached destination - our venue.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>OUR VENUE :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Our venue is renowned B.S. Abdur Rahman University, Tambaram, Chennai. We locals know it as Crescent Engineering College.
  	  	  	And the venue is situated near Vandaloor Zoo, which is very near and adjacent to the Vandaloor hill. So the elevation is
  	  	  	typically high than in other areas of Chennai on average. However, the most important thing not many of us are
  	  	  	aware of is, that the whole area is renowned for its bird diversity and density... So naturally, sometimes, i mean
  	  	  	sometimes - but not often - if i can exaggerate - shit shower might occur ....
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	   ha ha ha :). Yes you heard me right !
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	   	If one is ready to listen and observe closely, i am sure, u can <b>appreaciate the biodiversity, and health of forest
  	  	  	and venue mulched with bird droppings</b>. It is a great place to hang around, and the university is situated right in
  	  	  	center with broad, tall, huge, departmental buildings which i have never witnessed in my school or college days ! Coooool.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>WHO AM I ?</i></h3></p>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	As usual, i was helping around with some of other peers in volunteer group. Yet i still do not know whether i am a
  	  	  	volunteer, a speaker for workshop or a delegate or a individual..... I was literally in confusion how should i
  	  	  	react to people's expectation. Then as i usually would do, mixed with the flow and became part of the group :).
  	  	  	By the time, volunteers who were organizing accomodation for huge inflow of volunteers and delegates from FSMK,
  	  	  	FSHM, Swecha, DAKF, folks from westbengal, and other states, - were under huge pressure to organize rooms in university
  	  	  	hostel, including arranging beds and stuff. Literally, people were contacting nearby colleges to accomodate huge
  	  	  	barrier breaking influx of people.... and believe me this stuff is tough to do !!!... i never even dared to try...

  	  	  	<p><h3>DAY 0 - EMERGENCE OF FUN & CHAOS :</h3></p>
	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	<figure>
		  	  	  	<img src="../../../../assets/pics/misc/0.png" alt="day 0">
	  	  		</figure>
	  	  		After reaching the venue by evening, many of the local and neighbour state delegates
	  	  	  	were working on their volunteered responsibility and filled the emptiness wherever
	  	  	  	their service is needed. I on the other hand, hanged around with prasanna from FSHM,
	  	  	  	discussing about philosophy stuff, and sharing his own volunteered work of organizing
	  	  	  	the technical workshops in terms of dividing the volunteers to speakers, allocating
	  	  	  	rooms & their keys, by coordinating with the hall organization team - who literally
	  	  	  	has to bang their heads to get the information about the availabiility of halls.
	  	  	</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	In the mean time, we volunteers (yeah now i am in volunteer mode), gathered to
	  	  	  	organize by taking responsibilities, and sharing contacts of a experienced
	  	  	  	volunteer in a flat group fashion for more flexibility if not for efficiency. By the
	  	  	  	end of the meeting we had all other volunteers contact no.'s and handles that helped
	  	  	  	us organize ourselves.
	  	  	</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	By the end of the session some of us were addressing new volunteers about 4CCON, philosophy,
	  	  	  	practice, and so on stuff... Then we had wonderful moonlight dinner which we almost shared
	  	  	  	plates and felt a commune cooking experience.... :) I can still remember the taste of curry
	  	  	  	and rasam which i have packed in my PET bottle and drinking it often... like water :D
	  	  	</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	This process crossed mid-night, and till most of the work were chaotic and adhoc,
	  	  	  	without any proper procedure. I was startled to see that people emerge on their own
	  	  	  	taking the functionality that are floating around, and tried to complete as much as
	  	  	  	possible. I being as a speaker, fortunately relieved from workshop stuff - as i have
	  	  	  	prepared all the resources needed. That gave me window to help breathe the venue
	  	  	  	organization stuff. I learned hell looooooot of stuff practically about event
	  	  	  	organization, timing, resource management, as well as interesting group dynamics.
	  	  	</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	Now the second great challenge is, i have to handle the workshop session, with perfect
	  	  	  	combination of sleep deprivation and with no mental preparation of handling
	  	  	  	diverse peers who registered for my <b>GIS from & for commons</b> workshop. It is so
	  	  	  	fortunate to know that the total <b>no.</b> of registration was <b>≌  0</b>. I kind of felt
	  	  	  	much relieved, to handle probably only less no. of students - i hoped.
	  	  	</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	I can feel Entropy is in rise .... emerging from the group dynamics... awesome

  	  	      	<p><h3>DAY 1 - RESONATION & WORKSHOPS :</h3></p>
  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	<figure>
		  	  	  	<img src="../../../../assets/pics/misc/1.png" alt="day 1">
	  	  		</figure>
	  	  	  	Prasanna and other backend volunteers sleep deprieved, were still organizing stuff on accomodation,
	  	  	  	and hall arrangement for workshops. I managed to escape the chaos, and took some sleep by 2:00 A.M.
	  	  	  	and woke early to find that our hostel rooms either had a bad bathroom doors or at best does not have
	  	  	  	one.... :). <b><i>Talk to me about privacy.....</i></b>
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<h3>→ Before Session</h3>
  	  	  	<p>
				Aaaahhh.... Shit... i have to go to lu... and then i decided to convince myself to control my
  	  	  	  	natural instincts using heavy cognitive - neural - emotional dispersion - mechanisms. Then i remembered
  	  	  	  	that the main hall where we were working last night had awesome toilets, and decided to release my controls
  	  	  	  	& dams over there.... you should have seen my face bursting with emotions in between travel time.... from
  	  	  	  	hostel to the main hall - during which the watch man in the hostel have stopped me requesting some bags
  	  	  	  	for him assuming that i am the incharge of the whole guys staying in hostel. U know.. with my pressure
  	  	  	  	building up my behind, and in the verge of breaking, i have accepted his assumption and never explained him
  	  	  	  	that i was just one of other volunteers, and in turn assured him give him one - which i have never
  	  	  	  	fulfilled.... ;D
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	<b>LMFAO</b>... i bet every volunteer who stayed in the hostel would have undergone such control
  	  	  	  	mechanism atleast once.... :D
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<h3>→ During Session</h3>
  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Here comes the next big wave for me: Even after workshop session started, my allocated hall is still
  	  	  	  	empty. Then after arranging necessary resources like benches, projectors and stuff, ... then came the
  	  	  	  	spot registered students from a nearby college... I started as usual discussing and getting to know them.
  	  	  	  	They were just pre-final engineering students of E.C.E. <b>dealing them is cake piece..</b>
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Now enters a peer of elderly age who have worked in Kerala Agricultural University in GIS associated
  	  	  	  	with vegetation for 15+ years.... I bet no other workshops would have seen a participating peer of this
  	  	  	  	diversity. <b>Holy moly ! What shall i do now.... </b>
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Now, the second wave of people who of Geography professors teaching GIS, cartography, and were using
  	  	  	  	FOSS tools extensively in their life. Whereas, my GIS experience is just 3+ years and everything i learned
  	  	  	  	is sporadic and self taught in the free time i got. Although i believed my fundas are stronger, i thought
  	  	  	  	i could not even entertain them... and with continuous flow of students from nowehere the nearly empty
  	  	  	  	hall was filling and i had to restart everything often to the incoming people.
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Now i am literally confused where to start, on one side, we have got students who never opens their mouth
  	  	  	  	for any stuff i queried about.... on the other hand we've got experienced GIS experts... that is one hell of
  	  	  	  	a bandwidth range which i need time to think of... Have u ever seen <b>Dexter's laboratory ?</b>, in one of
  	  	  	  	the episondes, his brain would go haywire with his work pressure... i nearly felt like that. With overflowing
  	  	  	  	of GIS information which i had to cramp the 4 day content and provide it in one day and need to handle the
  	  	  	  	session... i was jumping between topics so wildly....
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Then came to my help, geography professors, who initiated a interactive session that helped relieve
  	  	  	  	my pressure and he took almost the whole morning session.... I learned a little bit of art of teching from him
  	  	  	  	;).... Had a nice little talk and gone for lunch. After lunch we assembled again and i have
  	  	  	  	demonstrated as much stuff as possible, and have infused usage of FOSS, tools, philosophies, etc wherever
  	  	  	  	possible - which have actually pressed me to write a blog post about the demonstration itself, so that
  	  	  	  	those who like to learn about it, can <a href="../../../../content/category/hackwork/try-terrain/try-terrain.html">try</a> it in their home.
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<h3>→ After Session</h3>

  	  	  	<p>
				Had nice dinner, physically tired, and then met my peer (Tamil Wikipedian & Entrepreneur).... <b><i>Lenin</i></b>,
  	  	  	  	master in Nano-Science officially, as usual we spoke about a lot on day to day stuff, and deep philosophical
  	  	  	  	shit too.  Particularly i like the language <b>+</b> slang of Lenin, the way he expresses stuff is common man and
  	  	  	  	simple. He is literally awesome as he is one of the key volunteer who have arranged for printing banner, drawing
  	  	  	  	logos, etc... even during pressing grave family situations. These men are the inspirors who made other volunteers
  	  	  	  	do the volunteering work so awesomely. During all discussions, we are accompanied by <b><i>Venkatesh</i></b> from
  	  	  	  	FSFTN - with all this interesting thoughts and intervention strategies.... that led me and Venkatesh to have a good
  	  	  	  	long talk.. :D
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	    </li>

  	  	    <br></br>
  	  	    <li>
  	  	      	<p><h3>DAY 2 - SPEECHES & DISCUSSIONS :</h3></p>
			<p>
	  	  	  	<figure>
		  	  	  	<img src="../../../../assets/pics/misc/2.png" alt="day 2">
	  	  		</figure>

	  	  	  	Whatever happened in DAY-1 morning - similar thing happened again in routine. After overcoming those, had an awesome
	  	  	  	breakfast and met all awesome people from neighbouring states and districts - discussing about the speech &
	  	  	  	discussion sessions. I have even tried speaking to new people whom i never know of... and it is kind of fun to do
	  	  	  	that !... :)
  	  	  	</p>

			<p>
			  	To my surprise, the schedule listed <b><i>Dr.Usha Ramanathan</i></b> in a panel discussion with <b><i>Thomas Franco</i></b>,
			  	<b><i>Srikanth L</i></b>, <b><i>Govinda Rao</i></b> & <b><i>Sharad Sharma</i></b> about Demonitization & Digital Infrastructure. I
			  	never expected her presence for the day. She is one of the key person that inspired me to think about stuff from different
			  	point of view. I have even read the book <a href="../../../../content/resource/books/Wages of Impunity Power, Justice and Human Rights.pdf">
			  	Wages of Impunity by K.G. Kannabiran</a> suggested by her few years ago, which gave me a further wider view of the situation of this
			  	country - its police, legislative, bureaucratic system, constitution, people & democracy by shedding new lights... on my
			  	interpreation & better understanding of Constitution and Systems.
			</p>

			<h3>→ Morning Session</h3>
			<p>
			  	Every session arranged is critical, and so i literally lost my opportunity to speak with <b><i>P.Sainath</i></b>, who did
			  	inspired my life in some way. But interestingly, i attended <b>Smart governance</b> handled by Srikanth Lakshmanan. We had
			  	good discussion about :
			  	<ul>
			  	  <li>E-governance</li>
			  	  <li>FAT in e-governance & its projects</li>
			  	  <li>Open-Data, gov. Open source policies</li>
			  	  <li>Aadhaar/UIDAI & UPI/India Stack based services</li>
			  	  <li>Open-government projects hosted in <a href="https://openforge.gov.in/">Open Forge</a></li>
			  	</ul>

				I personally have handed him a research query, which i am still waiting the answers for. I hope i would soon get his
			  	replies back. After so much pressure and almost 5 years of disobedience against Aadhar's <b>"Voluntarily Mandatory"</b>
			  	strategy, i had to enroll Aadhar for want of PDS - Food cornered by my present <b>Independent Research</b> situation.
			  	I am still happy to know that people like Srikanth are still do say <b>NO or NOT necessary</b> to Aadhaar. I hope that
			  	he does not fall into situations that mandates him to the gravity of enrolling of draconian Aadhaar scheme.
			</p>

			<h3>→ Afternoon Session</h3>
			<p>
				This is the more interesting experience i have ever had in the conference. This is the kind of experience i was searching
			  	for. The session is about introducing IndiaStacks to tech. communities like us. At first me and my peer.. was a bit skeptical
			  	in attending the session, but then we decided to learn <b><i>Sharad Sharma</i></b>'s point of view. During his presentation
			  	many of the points he pointed out as "public reasons" were contradictory to us. His interpretation seems to be founted
			  	& stemmed from the Silicon Valley, and rooted in pushing disruption and was felt it was never really about enabling and
			  	embracing local scenario. Even though his flamboyant presentation slides contain inclusion of "common man" scenario, the
			  	reasoning are completely out of scope. His interpretations of current scenario are in alignment with <b>commodification
				of privacy</b> for the sake of better facilitation.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	<b>His point is :</b> before any other MNC or conglomerate would commodify your privacy legally, why not we people let
			  	the government - private partnership within the nation do it ???. After all, government functionality nowadays are focussed
			  	more towards profit orientation rather than directive principles of state policy. So its either us or the big corporations.
			  	And as long as Aadhaar, UPI, and layers like India Stack are present, we will not let the potential market slip out of our hands.
			  	So people have no choice after demonitization, let everyone have a smartphone, pushing majority of the population to buy one,
			  	so that they could earn on average Rs.30 per day... so that we can unitely prove Aadhaar, UPI, IndiaStack are the fore front
			  	in governance technology....
			</p>

			<p>
			  	Congratulations, on confirming that we are no more even data-based subjects, but even reduced to toy objects living
			  	just to transact digital currencies.... :D
			</p>

			<p>
			  	Out of nowehere, he interestingly pulled whistle blower: <b>Edward Snowden</b> and made personal attacks on him without any
			  	proper proof. We both confronted this and then onwards he was completely ignoring our impetus and request to raise queries
			  	regarding architecture of IndiaStack and even i have had questions to him from a developmental economics point of view.
			  	Fortunately some of the other peers, who were still sane, asked him really proper questions in association with <b>open-source</b>
			  	policy of India Stack. Now the discussion so hot, that he too emotional, and started comparing hollywood movie industry
			  	policies with the governance here. He futher erupted emotionally and refuted the query with unnecessarily stench words, that
			  	would have hurt any person who have expected politeness and proper reasoning for a humble question. The guy who queried Sharad
			  	Sharma literally never expected such word flames....
			</p>

			<p>
			  	<b>Interesting eh ???</b> All these time, me and my peer do not know that <b>Usha Ramanathan</b> was sitting beside us and
			  	was listening to all these commotions happening in the hall. After recognizing that she is in the hall, i decided to go speak
			  	about law research, aadhaar, wages of impunity, stuff as we are moving towards the panel discussion in the auditorium which
			  	i was eagerly waiting for it till morning. As of then i was expecting a really good rational discussion in the panel maintaining
			  	they coool.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	<b>(but deep down ... i was expecting something different)</b>
			</p>

			<h3>→ Evening Session</h3>
			<p>
				The panel discussion started after me having little talks with Usha Ramanathan and Franco Thomas. Panel was set and initiated
			  	by Thomas Franco about demonitization & digital infrastructure. Again all speakers were rationally explaining their views
			  	while Sharad Sharma took emotion as his strategy, and resembled the Charlie Chaplin's climax speech profile in "The Great dictator",
			  	expect that this views sound subjugative atleast for few of us. Do not assume that he made a great speech just because i have
			  	compared his speech profile with Charlie Chaplin's.... <b>Beware :D</b>
			</p>

			<p>
			  	With good points made by all, the session ended peacefully in a progressive way - while everyone not accepting specific views of
			  	Sharad Sharma - and made it clear to the public attending the session through their gestures, which unfortunately Sharad Sharma
			  	would not have possibly seen. Those who have understood little bit of liberty, democracy, constituion, and the present state of
			  	the system, gave <b>standing ovation</b> to Usha Ramanathan and Thomas Franco. We are not driven by emotion, but the ovation
			  	emerged out of us, spontaneously, that helped made the situation clear on how the dots are connected with opportunistic mindset. I
			  	believe that those who appreciated it, has certain degree of criticality to it.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	Panel concluded with that the Financial institutions, Governance, Bureaucracy can function in a much better way with empathy and
			  	not by robbing/alienating people by pushing them to a new infrastructure that has many problems and most of the part was
			  	infused in practice in unconstitutional way ! (aadhaar as money bill and first implemented before even passing the bill... moreover
			  	a republic government must look forward to create act if there is need for written privacy law in constitution - instead the governments
			  	we chose, are using it as a business pot to churn out profits and control mechanisms...).

			<h3>→ Cultural</h3>

			<p>
			  	I never thought, that volunteers would arrange <b>Thappattam (தப்பாட்டம்)</b> from my home district. I love two folk
			  	arts very deeply. One is <b>Devarattam (தேவராட்டம்)</b> that uses <b>Urumi (உருமி)</b>, and the other is thappattam,
			  	that almost mesmerizes anybody in TamilNadu. And this time, it has proved that it has proved its artistic influx
			  	into almost everyone who came to the auditorium. I never danced, instead i was crying altogether, as a form of
			  	expression and was keenly observing the dance, their leg, hand, instrument movements, graceness, etc,..... I was
			  	crying for a long time. I hope everybody would have enjoyed <b>celebration of life</b> from the music and flamboyant
			  	performance of the artists.

			<h3>→ Night in Hostel</h3>
			<p>
			  	Aftern reaching hoste, me and prasanna decided to engage new volunteers, and all others in the surrounding to help them
			  	learn about the necessity of <b>alternative thinking</b> in social, techno-social, techno-political domains, that gave
			  	prasanna to start the discussion with querying about the each ones understanding on centralized, decnetralized, grassroots
			  	based systems - atleast in social networking point of view. We both along with others in the room seemed to attact towards
			  	a critical discussion about the architectural influence of networking technology in communication, social reflection, etc..
			  	The discussion went so long and interesting at some point we simulated situations of centralized social networking and people
			  	seem to kindle their thought process and thought really about the advantages and limitations of the system.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	We then replicated similar simulation strategy for other structural/architectural modes of networking namely, decentralized/
			  	federated and grass-roots networking. People tend to clearly understand where architecure comes in, where structure emerges,
			  	how they both influences information flow, what founted data commodification, etc... from unbiased view as much as we
			  	capable of handling. It is like my brain took a trip in <b>Psilocybin</b> by just taking part in the disucssion alone. We have
			  	not only deliberated about the advantages and limitations of each systems and ideas, but tend to come to certain conclusions
			  	of where to use what.... in other words... location based implementation <b>+</b> scenario (anti-ignorance) based implementation.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	We felt that such deliberation is necessary because, these are the technology which are going to emerge as alternatives to
			  	present communication infrastructure which has to be shaped towards a progressive functionality rather than a profit yielding
			  	functionality alone. It happened in a democratic way apart from sporadic heated arguments over unproved claims.

	  <p><h3>WHY THE HELL AM I USING A CENTRALIZED COMMENTING SYSTEM ?</h3></p>
	  <p>
	  	Eventhough i am philosophically oriented, inclined and aligned to, grassroots, self hosting, decentralized/federated communication
	  	& web services,to reach maximal audience i have to undergo serious compromises to my critical self and enable centralized services
	  	like disqus which we shall be used for criticizing and discussing about the topic specific to this article.... :). I believe we are
	  	all in transition towards a more meshed, federated & socially auditable internet and in the mean time, i had to make such compromises
	  	to reach humans out there... !

	  <p>
	    	In near future i have planned to learn about completely self reliable and self hosted grassroots communication services. Only then
	    	i can live upto my thoughts. Until then, i would have to undergo such compromises that puts me in a awkward situation.
