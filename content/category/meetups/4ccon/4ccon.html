  	  	<p>Hey there <b>!</b></p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLIAMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Hey folks, i am just expressing my view of awesome <a href="https://4ccon.fsmi.in/">4CCON conference</a>
  	  	  	that i experienced by being a part of the conference volunteer and workshop speaker. I neither endorse
  	  	  	nor express any objective view. The following incidents were totally of my fun and stuff that happened
  	  	  	in the national meetup.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	This is going to be long read if u attempt to read it fully. U can choose a section and read it instead.
  	  	  	If u came to download some stuff... then scroll down and u will find them near the end of the post -
  	  	  	marked as Links and Downloads.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	If u cannot tolerate profanity, i humbly ask you to leave this site and go browse something eye candy !
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>INTRO :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	So, being around with communities like FSFTN, FSMK, FSHM atleast for a few years and having a huge
  	  	  	set of awesome peers and friends, i know to a certain extent how these dudes work during a public event
  	  	  	like this. Atleast, i have been part in some other events, which was organized locally in some
  	  	  	districts of TamilNadu, Karnataka. The volunteers who worked in 4CCON, behind the banner designs, who worked
  	  	  	behind catering food, who involved in accomodation of huge volunteer density, who involved in arranging
  	  	  	technical workshops(even in chaos), who took pain in coinvincing university staff that requires tight and
  	  	  	right at the edge planning & execution, who designed & coded the awesome website, who involved in handling
  	  	  	the workshops, who helped take videos the conference, arrange live updates, creating news cast... and most
  	  	  	of the other folks who run here and there without ever knowing why they even actually running and doing things...
  	  	</p>

  	  		</figure>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	and by the way, there are folks like me, who go there, eat food, free load stuff, observe people, involve
  	  	  	in discussion, hang around people, raise questions.... you know doing stuff the humans do in a group... :)
  	  	  	in short we are the psychedelics of the conference, who keep the groups relaxed, tensed, fun, and so on...
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Did i mentioned ? the conference is not only about propagating free/open source software & hardware, policies,
  	  	  	philosophies, practicies, tools & sharing knowledge stuff... this time it has marked a significant step
  	  	  	towards a social progression, through active civic participation & democratic policy intervention which as a
  	  	  	social movement people tirelessly involved since its inception 6 years ago !

  	  	<p><h3><i>MY PLANNING :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
			I have registed for the conference to handle a workshop on GIS, to share my learning and experiences,
  	  		workflow with peers who are interested and liked to share similar stuff. I have registed atleast a
  	  		month early. That gave me a pretty much wider bandwidth to think about the workshop, and accomodated
  	  		stuff into a LaTeX based presentation from my notes, block diagrams, screenshots, drawings... u know.
  	  		In the process i assumed that the workshop would be scheduled for 4 days, and so i have been mentally
  	  		preparing and organizing the content and content delivey. (U know assumptions are the seed of all fuckups !)
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
			One fine day, one of the organizer, from FSFTN telephoned me regarding something which i dont remember about, and in
  	  	  	the conversation, he informed that the workshop will all be held in one day...! That is all, enough for
  	  	  	me to put my congnition regarding conference in jeopardy.... and have decided to cramp all the 70+ slides
  	  	  	within a day.... ! Lets see how it goes....
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Basically my planning was resetted and i have to go adhoc !, which will be interesting to handle.... :D
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>ME TRAVELLING :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	This is during while almost all youth and people were confused about, thinking, contemplating, critically processing
  	  	  	their decisions, emotionally acting, democratically protesting for <b>Jallikattu</b>. Just a day or two before
  	  	  	starting my journey for the cornference, two delegates from FSMK were travelling from Bangalore, to Chennai, by
  	  	  	train via Katpadi, which is when political intervention resulted in their train held up without any
  	  	  	further announcement. One of my friend telephoned me, when i fortunately picked and asked me to help them out...
		</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Even with all commotion happening in chennai, people from other districts, other states have accumulated in
  	  	  	Chennai, and volunteering seriously for atleast a month afaik.

  	  	    	 <figure>
	  	  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/pictures/meetup-4ccon/volunteers-in-fsftn-office.jpg" alt="volunteers-in-fsftn">
	  	  	  	<figcaption><b>some of the core volunteers in FSFTN office, Chennai</b></figcaption>
  	  		</figure>

  	  	    	It is a photo pic, showing some of the core volunteers discussing about the even management stuff.... :)
  	  	    	Don't even think... i was not there when this happened...
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	We had good time, during their stay over in my home... and helped them travel to Chennai next day morning via bus.
  	  	  	Then comes my turn, and after finishing some of the works in home, and taking leave from my home duty, i travelled
  	  	  	to Chennai from Vellore 25th morning, helped arranging some stuff, getting to know new people, starting having fun,
  	  	  	travelled via train to the station along with other coooool peers and finally reached destination - our venue.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>OUR VENUE :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Our venue is renowned B.S. Abdur Rahman University, Tambaram, Chennai. We locals know it as Crescent Engineering College.
  	  	  	And the venue is situated near Vandaloor Zoo, which is very near and adjacent to the Vandaloor hill. So the elevation is
  	  	  	typically high than in other areas of Chennai on average. However, the most important thing not many of us are
  	  	  	aware of is, that the whole area is renowned for its bird diversity and density... So naturally, sometimes, i mean
  	  	  	sometimes - but not often - if i can exaggerate - shit shower might occur ....
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	   ha ha ha :). Yes you heard me right !
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	   	If one is ready to listen and observe closely, i am sure, u can <b>appreaciate the biodiversity, and health of forest
  	  	  	and venue mulched with bird droppings</b>. It is a great place to hang around, and the university is situated right in
  	  	  	center with broad, tall, huge, departmental buildings which i have never witnessed in my school or college days ! Coooool.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>WHO AM I ?</i></h3></p>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	As usual, i was helping around with some of other peers in volunteer group. Yet i still do not know whether i am a
  	  	  	volunteer, a speaker for workshop or a delegate or a individual..... I was literally in confusion how should i
  	  	  	react to people's expectation. Then as i usually would do, mixed with the flow and became part of the group :).
  	  	  	By the time, volunteers who were organizing accomodation for huge inflow of volunteers and delegates from FSMK,
  	  	  	FSHM, Swecha, DAKF, folks from westbengal, and other states, - were under huge pressure to organize rooms in university
  	  	  	hostel, including arranging beds and stuff. Literally, people were contacting nearby colleges to accomodate huge
  	  	  	barrier breaking influx of people.... and believe me this stuff is tough to do !!!... i never even dared to try...

  	  	  	<p><h3>DAY 0 - EMERGENCE OF FUN & CHAOS :</h3></p>
	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	<figure>
		  	  	  	<img src="../../../../assets/pics/misc/0.png" alt="day 0">
	  	  		</figure>

	  	  		After reaching the venue by evening, many of the local and neighbour state delegates
	  	  	  	were working on their volunteered responsibility and filled the emptiness wherever
	  	  	  	their service is needed. I on the other hand, hanged around with prasanna from FSHM,
	  	  	  	discussing about philosophy stuff, and sharing his own volunteered work of organizing
	  	  	  	the technical workshops in terms of dividing the volunteers to speakers, allocating
	  	  	  	rooms & their keys, by coordinating with the hall organization team - who literally
	  	  	  	has to bang their heads to get the information about the availabiility of halls.
	  	  	</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	In the mean time, we volunteers (yeah now i am in volunteer mode), gathered to
	  	  	  	organize by taking responsibilities, and sharing contacts of a experienced
	  	  	  	volunteer in a flat group fashion for more flexibility if not for efficiency. By the
	  	  	  	end of the meeting we had all other volunteers contact no.'s and handles that helped
	  	  	  	us organize ourselves.
	  	  	</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	By the end of the session some of us were addressing new volunteers about 4CCON, philosophy,
	  	  	  	practice, and so on stuff... Then we had wonderful moonlight dinner which we almost shared
	  	  	  	plates and felt a commune cooking experience.... :) I can still remember the taste of curry
	  	  	  	and rasam which i have packed in my PET bottle and drinking it often... like water :D
	  	  	</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	This process crossed mid-night, and till most of the work were chaotic and adhoc,
	  	  	  	without any proper procedure. I was startled to see that people emerge on their own
	  	  	  	taking the functionality that are floating around, and tried to complete as much as
	  	  	  	possible. I being as a speaker, fortunately relieved from workshop stuff - as i have
	  	  	  	prepared all the resources needed. That gave me window to help breathe the venue
	  	  	  	organization stuff. I learned hell looooooot of stuff practically about event
	  	  	  	organization, timing, resource management, as well as interesting group dynamics.
	  	  	</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	Now the second great challenge is, i have to handle the workshop session, with perfect
	  	  	  	combination of sleep deprivation and with no mental preparation of handling
	  	  	  	diverse peers who registered for my <b>GIS from & for commons</b> workshop. It is so
	  	  	  	fortunate to know that the total <b>no.</b> of registration was <b>≌  0</b>. I kind of felt
	  	  	  	much relieved, to handle probably only less no. of students - i hoped.
	  	  	</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	I can feel Entropy is in rise .... emerging from the group dynamics... awesome
	  	  	</p>

  	  	    <li>
  	  	      	<p><h3>DAY 1 - RESONATION & WORKSHOPS :</h3></p>
  	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	<figure>
		  	  	  	<img src="../../../../assets/pics/misc/1.png" alt="day 1">
	  	  		</figure>

	  	  	  	Prasanna and other backend volunteers sleep deprieved, were still organizing stuff on accomodation,
	  	  	  	and hall arrangement for workshops. I managed to escape the chaos, and took some sleep by 2:00 A.M.
	  	  	  	and woke early to find that our hostel rooms either had a bad bathroom doors or at best does not have
	  	  	  	one.... :). <b><i>Talk to me about privacy.....</i></b>
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<h3>→ Before Session</h3>
  	  	  	<p>
				Aaaahhh.... Shit... i have to go to lu... and then i decided to convince myself to control my
  	  	  	  	natural instincts using heavy cognitive - neural - emotional dispersion - mechanisms. Then i remembered
  	  	  	  	that the main hall where we were working last night had awesome toilets, and decided to release my controls
  	  	  	  	& dams over there.... you should have seen my face bursting with emotions in between travel time.... from
  	  	  	  	hostel to the main hall - during which the watch man in the hostel have stopped me requesting some bags
  	  	  	  	for him assuming that i am the incharge of the whole guys staying in hostel. U know.. with my pressure
  	  	  	  	building up my behind, and in the verge of breaking, i have accepted his assumption and never explained him
  	  	  	  	that i was just one of other volunteers, and in turn assured him give him one - which i have never
  	  	  	  	fulfilled.... ;D
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	<b>LMFAO</b>... i bet every volunteer who stayed in the hostel would have undergone such control
  	  	  	  	mechanism atleast once.... :D
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<h3>→ During Session</h3>
  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Here comes the next big wave for me: Even after workshop session started, my allocated hall is still
  	  	  	  	empty. Then after arranging necessary resources like benches, projectors and stuff, ... then came the
  	  	  	  	spot registered students from a nearby college... I started as usual discussing and getting to know them.
  	  	  	  	They were just pre-final engineering students of E.C.E. <b>dealing them is cake piece..</b>
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Now enters a peer of elderly age who have worked in Kerala Agricultural University in GIS associated
  	  	  	  	with vegetation for 15+ years.... I bet no other workshops would have seen a participating peer of this
  	  	  	  	diversity. <b>Holy moly ! What shall i do now.... </b>
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Now, the second wave of people who of Geography professors teaching GIS, cartography, and were using
  	  	  	  	FOSS tools extensively in their life. Whereas, my GIS experience is just 3+ years and everything i learned
  	  	  	  	is sporadic and self taught in the free time i got. Although i believed my fundas are stronger, i thought
  	  	  	  	i could not even entertain them... and with continuous flow of students from nowehere the nearly empty
  	  	  	  	hall was filling and i had to restart everything often to the incoming people.
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Now i am literally confused where to start, on one side, we have got students who never opens their mouth
  	  	  	  	for any stuff i queried about.... on the other hand we've got experienced GIS experts... that is one hell of
  	  	  	  	a bandwidth range which i need time to think of... Have u ever seen <b>Dexter's laboratory ?</b>, in one of
  	  	  	  	the episondes, his brain would go haywire with his work pressure... i nearly felt like that. With overflowing
  	  	  	  	of GIS information which i had to cramp the 4 day content and provide it in one day and need to handle the
  	  	  	  	session... i was jumping between topics so wildly....
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<p>
  	  	  	  	Then came to my help, geography professors, who initiated a interactive session that helped relieve
  	  	  	  	my pressure and he took almost the whole morning session.... I learned a little bit of art of teching from him
  	  	  	  	;).... Had a nice little talk and gone for lunch. After lunch we assembled again and i have
  	  	  	  	demonstrated as much stuff as possible, and have infused usage of FOSS, tools, philosophies, etc wherever
  	  	  	  	possible - which have actually pressed me to write a blog post about the demonstration itself, so that
  	  	  	  	those who like to learn about it, can <a href="../../../../content/category/hackwork/try-terrain/try-terrain.html">try</a> it in their home.
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	  	<h3>→ After Session</h3>

  	  	  	<p>
				Had nice dinner, physically tired, and then met my peer (Tamil Wikipedian & Entrepreneur).... <b><i>Lenin</i></b>,
  	  	  	  	master in Nano-Science officially, as usual we spoke about a lot on day to day stuff, and deep philosophical
  	  	  	  	shit too.  Particularly i like the language <b>+</b> slang of Lenin, the way he expresses stuff is common man and
  	  	  	  	simple. He is literally awesome as he is one of the key volunteer who have arranged for printing banner, drawing
  	  	  	  	logos, etc... even during pressing grave family situations. These men are the inspirors who made other volunteers
  	  	  	  	do the volunteering work so awesomely. During all discussions, we are accompanied by <b><i>Venkatesh</i></b> from
  	  	  	  	FSFTN - with all this interesting thoughts and intervention strategies.... that led me and Venkatesh to have a good
  	  	  	  	long talk.. :D
  	  	  	</p>

  	  	    </li>

  	  	    <br></br>

		  	  	  	<img src="../../../../assets/pics/misc/2.png" alt="day 2">
	  	  		</figure>

	  	  	  	Whatever happened in DAY-1 morning - similar thing happened again in routine. After overcoming those, had an awesome
	  	  	  	breakfast and met all awesome people from neighbouring states and districts - discussing about the speech &
	  	  	  	discussion sessions. I have even tried speaking to new people whom i never know of... and it is kind of fun to do
	  	  	  	that !... :)
  	  	  	</p>

			<p> The following video is the 2nd day newscast and highlight about the sessions & conference.. watch it for TLDR :D</p>

			<div class="content-video">
			  	<iframe width="320" height="180" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHigCz7YTOc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			</div>

			<p>
			  	To my surprise, the schedule listed <b><i>Dr.Usha Ramanathan</i></b> in a panel discussion with <b><i>Thomas Franco</i></b>,
			  	<b><i>Srikanth L</i></b>, <b><i>Govinda Rao</i></b> & <b><i>Sharad Sharma</i></b> about Demonitization & Digital Infrastructure. I
			  	never expected her presence for the day. She is one of the key person that inspired me to think about stuff from different
			  	point of view. I have even read the book <a href="../../../../content/resource/books/Wages of Impunity Power, Justice and Human Rights.pdf">
			  	Wages of Impunity by K.G. Kannabiran</a> suggested by her few years ago, which gave me a further wider view of the situation of this
			  	country - its police, legislative, bureaucratic system, constitution, people & democracy by shedding new lights... on my
			  	interpreation & better understanding of Constitution and Systems.
			</p>

			<h3>→ Morning Session</h3>
			<p>
			  	Every session arranged is critical, and so i literally lost my opportunity to speak with <b><i>P.Sainath</i></b>, who did
			  	inspired my life in some way. But interestingly, i attended <b>Smart governance</b> handled by Srikanth Lakshmanan. We had
			  	good discussion about :
			  	<ul>
			  	  <li>E-governance</li>
			  	  <li>FAT in e-governance & its projects</li>
			  	  <li>Open-Data, gov. Open source policies</li>
			  	  <li>Aadhaar/UIDAI & UPI/India Stack based services</li>
			  	  <li>Open-government projects hosted in <a href="https://openforge.gov.in/">Open Forge</a></li>
			  	</ul>

				I personally have handed him a research query, which i am still waiting the answers for. I hope i would soon get his
			  	replies back. After so much pressure and almost 5 years of disobedience against Aadhar's <b>"Voluntarily Mandatory"</b>
			  	strategy, i had to enroll Aadhar for want of PDS - Food cornered by my present <b>Independent Research</b> situation.
			  	I am still happy to know that people like Srikanth are still do say <b>NO or NOT necessary</b> to Aadhaar. I hope that
			  	he does not fall into situations that mandates him to the gravity of enrolling of draconian Aadhaar scheme.
			</p>

			<h3>→ Afternoon Session</h3>
			<p>
				This is the more interesting experience i have ever had in the conference. This is the kind of experience i was searching
			  	for. The session is about introducing IndiaStacks to tech. communities like us. At first me and my peer.. was a bit skeptical
			  	in attending the session, but then we decided to learn <b><i>Sharad Sharma</i></b>'s point of view. During his presentation
			  	many of the points he pointed out as "public reasons" were contradictory to us. His interpretation seems to be founted
			  	& stemmed from the Silicon Valley, and rooted in pushing disruption and was felt it was never really about enabling and
			  	embracing local scenario. Even though his flamboyant presentation slides contain inclusion of "common man" scenario, the
			  	reasoning are completely out of scope. His interpretations of current scenario are in alignment with <b>commodification
				of privacy</b> for the sake of better facilitation.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	<b>His point is :</b> before any other MNC or conglomerate would commodify your privacy legally, why not we people let
			  	the government - private partnership within the nation do it ???. After all, government functionality nowadays are focussed
			  	more towards profit orientation rather than directive principles of state policy. So its either us or the big corporations.
			  	And as long as Aadhaar, UPI, and layers like India Stack are present, we will not let the potential market slip out of our hands.
			  	So people have no choice after demonitization, let everyone have a smartphone, pushing majority of the population to buy one,
			  	so that they could earn on average Rs.30 per day... so that we can unitely prove Aadhaar, UPI, IndiaStack are the fore front
			  	in governance technology....
			</p>

			<p>
			  	Congratulations, on confirming that we are no more even data-based subjects, but even reduced to toy objects living
			  	just to transact digital currencies.... :D
			</p>

			<p>
			  	Out of nowehere, he interestingly pulled whistle blower: <b>Edward Snowden</b> and made personal attacks on him without any
			  	proper proof. We both confronted this and then onwards he was completely ignoring our impetus and request to raise queries
			  	regarding architecture of IndiaStack and even i have had questions to him from a developmental economics point of view.
			  	Fortunately some of the other peers, who were still sane, asked him really proper questions in association with <b>open-source</b>
			  	policy of India Stack. Now the discussion so hot, that he too emotional, and started comparing hollywood movie industry
			  	policies with the governance here. He futher erupted emotionally and refuted the query with unnecessarily stench words, that
			  	would have hurt any person who have expected politeness and proper reasoning for a humble question. The guy who queried Sharad
			  	Sharma literally never expected such word flames....
			</p>

			<p>
			  	<b>Interesting eh ???</b> All these time, me and my peer do not know that <b>Usha Ramanathan</b> was sitting beside us and
			  	was listening to all these commotions happening in the hall. After recognizing that she is in the hall, i decided to go speak
			  	about law research, aadhaar, wages of impunity, stuff as we are moving towards the panel discussion in the auditorium which
			  	i was eagerly waiting for it till morning. As of then i was expecting a really good rational discussion in the panel maintaining
			  	they coool.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	<b>(but deep down ... i was expecting something different)</b>
			</p>

			<h3>→ Evening Session</h3>
			<p>
				The panel discussion started after me having little talks with Usha Ramanathan and Franco Thomas. Panel was set and initiated
			  	by Thomas Franco about demonitization & digital infrastructure. Again all speakers were rationally explaining their views
			  	while Sharad Sharma took emotion as his strategy, and resembled the Charlie Chaplin's climax speech profile in "The Great dictator",
			  	expect that this views sound subjugative atleast for few of us. Do not assume that he made a great speech just because i have
			  	compared his speech profile with Charlie Chaplin's.... <b>Beware :D</b>
			</p>

			<p>
			  	With good points made by all, the session ended peacefully in a progressive way - while everyone not accepting specific views of
			  	Sharad Sharma - and made it clear to the public attending the session through their gestures, which unfortunately Sharad Sharma
			  	would not have possibly seen. Those who have understood little bit of liberty, democracy, constituion, and the present state of
			  	the system, gave <b>standing ovation</b> to Usha Ramanathan and Thomas Franco. We are neither driven by emotion, nor by overhonorary
			  	but the ovation emerged out of us, spontaneously, that helped made the situation clear on how the dots are connected with opportunistic
			  	mindset. I believe that those who appreciated it, has certain degree of criticality to it.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	Panel concluded with that the Financial institutions, Governance, Bureaucracy can function in a much better way with empathy and
			  	not by robbing/alienating people by pushing them to a new infrastructure that has many problems and most of the part was
			  	infused in practice in unconstitutional way ! (aadhaar as money bill and first implemented before even passing the bill... moreover
			  	a republic government must look forward to create act if there is need for written privacy law in constitution - instead the governments
			  	we chose, are using it as a business pot to churn out profits and control mechanisms...).

			<h3>→ Cultural</h3>

			<p>
			  	I never thought, that volunteers would arrange <b>Thappattam (தப்பாட்டம்)</b> from my home district. I love two folk
			  	arts very deeply. One is <b>Devarattam (தேவராட்டம்)</b> that uses <b>Urumi (உருமி)</b>, and the other is thappattam,
			  	that almost mesmerizes anybody in TamilNadu. And this time, it has proved that it has proved its artistic influx
			  	into almost everyone who came to the auditorium. I never danced, instead i was crying altogether, as a form of
			  	expression and was keenly observing the dance, their leg, hand, instrument movements, graceness, etc,..... I was
			  	crying for a long time. I hope everybody would have enjoyed <b>celebration of life</b> from the music and flamboyant
			  	performance of the artists.

			<h3>→ Night in Hostel</h3>
			<p>
			  	Aftern reaching hoste, me and prasanna decided to engage new volunteers, and all others in the surrounding to help them
			  	learn about the necessity of <b>alternative thinking</b> in social, techno-social, techno-political domains, that gave
			  	prasanna to start the discussion with querying about the each ones understanding on centralized, decnetralized, grassroots
			  	based systems - atleast in social networking point of view. We both along with others in the room seemed to attact towards
			  	a critical discussion about the architectural influence of networking technology in communication, social reflection, etc..
			  	The discussion went so long and interesting at some point we simulated situations of centralized social networking and people
			  	seem to kindle their thought process and thought really about the advantages and limitations of the system.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	We then replicated similar simulation strategy for other structural/architectural modes of networking namely, decentralized/
			  	federated and grass-roots networking. People tend to clearly understand where architecure comes in, where structure emerges,
			  	how they both influences information flow, what founted data commodification, etc... from unbiased view as much as we
			  	capable of handling. It is like my brain took a trip in <b>Psilocybin</b> by just taking part in the disucssion alone. We have
			  	not only deliberated about the advantages and limitations of each systems and ideas, but tend to come to certain conclusions
			  	of where to use what.... in other words... location based implementation <b>+</b> scenario (anti-ignorance) based implementation.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	We felt that such deliberation is necessary because, these are the technology which are going to emerge as alternatives to
			  	present communication infrastructure which has to be shaped towards a progressive functionality rather than a profit yielding
			  	functionality alone. It happened in a democratic way apart from sporadic heated arguments over unproved claims.

			<h3>→ Morning Session</h3>
			<p>
				I was helping Prasanna from FSHM & <a href="https://pymeshnet.gitlab.io/">PyMesh</a> in organizing his session, bringing up the router, etc... stuff,
	  	  	  	to demonstrate to the attendees a good idea about the <b>commons-infrastructure</b> & grass-roots
	  	  	  	oriented mesh networks. The session is organized to share the stage equally for introducing
	  	  	  	about <a href="https://www.freedomboxfoundation.org/">Freedom Box</a> and the experimentations <b>Bhuvan Krishna</b> and his Hardware/Software
	  	  	  	community in <b>Swecha</b> doing with it. The goal of the shared introduction is to trigger
	  	  	  	an alternative thought process by igniting about the current infrastructure that connects us, and
	  	  	  	make them understand how fragile it is.
	  	  	</p>

			<p>
			  	However, the Freedom box, session took much time than anticipated, as it has to be explained
			  	properly for all the attendees, and the interesting experimentations, successess, failures they
			  	had with it, while deploying in a village, etc... People seem to understand atleast a little
			  	bit about where Freedom Box is attacking the problem to solve the <b>Man in the middle</b>, as
			  	well as Commons-infrastructure approach to solve the same problem. What i have learned is that,
			  	both the vector is necessary and complement each other essentially. For example, project like
			  	Freedom Box, could run overlay web services that enable people communicate with their present
			  	knowledge - respecting <b>empathy</b>, creating a social mobilization one at a time, creating
			  	an emergent awareness socially.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	Whereas, we hacktivists, who cannot hold our horses, to try new stuff and bang our heads with
			  	problems and philosophies, have decided to try Freedom Box style and then moved to a Radio-Mesh,
			  	in other words, community networks where the network architecutre and topology will primarily
			  	be decentralized/federated, that essentially requires commons based peer production and social
			  	auditing in the long run, requiring people who could understand the fundamental functional nature
			  	- which is what we believe Freedom Box like projects will enable in near future.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	With more and more democratic uprising, people will ask and require more and more independent,
			  	disaster/delay tolerant networking infrastructure - while affordable by all. This is a alternative
			  	path towards <b>Communication is not luxury, not even utility, but a necessity</b>. The potential
			  	in Indian scenario is just now starting and lot of cracks, emptiness, grey areas needs to be filled
			  	by interested and skilled people.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	The session, ended smoothly with queries raising about hidden centralization in decentralized networks,
			  	about hardware used in FreedomBox, etc... which we were expecting from the audience. Prasanna & Bhuvan
			  	have optimally answered the questions they could answer, and with hunger, everybody were eager to have
			  	lunch.... :D.
			</p>

			<h3>→ Afternoon Session</h3>
			<p>
				I and some of my friends/peers attended <b>Smart Cities</b> session handled by <b>Francesca Bria</b> &
			  	<b>Evgeny Morozov</b>. I was waiting for their opinion and Barcelonas experience in having grass-roots
			  	strategy, contribution towards building real smart cities that embraced participation of citizens. One best
			  	example would be consulting <a href="https://guifi.net/en/">guifi</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	Sicne, i have been working in GIS, where lot of international, grass-roots collaborative effort similar to
			  	Wikipedia is happening - especially in Open Street Maps, i know that there is a best opportunity that
			  	Union of India, and corresponding departments will access those data along with their own surveys to build
			  	Smart cities that they invasion. In this case, there is a good chance that the data could be used
			  	unethically for panopticon surveillance atleast theoretically... Here people are contemplating GIS using
			  	GIS information regulation bill, where as around the world, all major public funded research institutions
			  	have been releasing data to the public under public domain, and using public participation from city planning
			  	to surveying, to forest fire mitigation, and disaster recovery. On the other hand, our smart cities, seems
			  	to be filled with surveillance cameras in a panopticon fashion, as <b>one nation under CCTV</b>, even before
			  	taking eradicating actions against poverty - which is the true cause of social unrest, and emergence of
			  	anti-social elements.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	Definetely, the government here does not seem to solve the real problems by facing the truth, instead
			  	uses Technology as a blanket to paste a membrane in front of people, literlly fooling them and make
			  	believe using voluntarily mandatory & economic push strategies as the path towards development.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	My question to her was, what are all the strategies people in Catalonia to make their governance enable
			  	what people need and embrace the participation eventually leading to a effective social auditing system
			  	by culture. Her long answer, is that, they initially faced lot political depressions and changes which
			  	they have to go through and make it work in order to make use of technology properly - which is what
			  	i was expecting. And that further made peers in the hall, accept and encourage such points, which have
			  	sowed new seeds in new people influxing into communities - who have initially believed that technology
			  	alone can change everything. After this conversation i have heard people talking about social and political
			  	stands that they need to face with technology in hand. Which is a great improvement, and i believe as one
			  	of the expectations of this conference.
			</p>

			<h3>→ Evening Session</h3>
			<p>
			  	<b>Our Digital Future</b> session was handled by <b>Neville Roy Singham</b>. As usual, he has
			  	expressed his activist side and have shown really good presentation that recorded and reported
			  	statistics on current state of employment and the projected future state, social action,
			  	etc... and so on. However, i personally felt that his talk was more emotionally motivated that
			  	too have created a paranoia among the crowd with <b>fear of losing jobs</b> :D, that actually
			  	made the crowd emotionally attached to this talk.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	you see paranoia, is a great tool, to draw & leverage attention - lights up the senses.
			</p>

			<p>
			  	I kind of felt over honourary in the crowd - even among my peers, toward the speech. However, the
			  	speech is great. It would have been even great, if he has extended his speech on how would it be
			  	when nobody has a job to do and there might be a good chance to pursue whatever they are passionate
			  	and interested in. That would be so faaaawwwking awesome, and would have further raised questions
			  	about critical use of technology - dispersing its usage in all fields possible.
			</p>

			<h3>→ Cultural</h3>
			<p>
				Third day, we were enjoying melodical songs from carnatic origins, and the orchestration initiated
			  	with <b>Thirukkural (திருக்குறள்)</b>, continued to sing great inspirational and melody songs from
			  	atleast 5 different language which i could recognize the difference. Its truly a awesome and
			  	diversified expereince. I could still hum something that caught my attention, which i cannot express
			  	in words... or even with my vocals.... dont ask me to do that.... With the lack of words to express,
			  	i am not going to say anything further.... :D
			</p>

			<p>
			  	After the completion and great send off for the carnatic orchestration, folks filed 100 years of Tamil
			  	Cinema, which is a great video collection of Movie clips of famous scenes, put together by Raj Video
			  	Visions. People enjoyed it watching and could really witness how the cinema over here has emerged and
			  	evolved with lot of variations, updates.... etc... But sadly with lack of time and strict regulations,
			  	the movie was abruptly stopped and we disbanded back to our hostels discussing stuff which we left
			  	last night.

	  	  	  	Since i am not a official member of any of the organization taking part in the conference, i must
	  	  		not put down my views about their meetings and practice. However, as a viewer, i found a significant
	  	  	  	part of democratic practice in all the organization.
	  	 	</p>

			<p>
			  	People, know me as a man who does not uses a "smart phone". Now in the very last day, i have successfully
			  	lost my phone that transformed/promoted me from <b>near luddite</b> to <b>real luddite</b> state. I searched
			  	for it in all possible places and still i cannot find it. All contacts gone... <i>poooofff</i> :D. However,
			  	i came to now, that some other guy have even lost his laptop. thats really sad. I hope he did not have
			  	any of his vital/research data. I learned how not to search for a phone by the way. Thanks to those
			  	awesome volunteers who helped me search for the phone and spread the news through their internal chat
			  	groups... :)
			</p>
  	  	    </li>
  	  	  </ul>

  	  	  <br></br>

  	  	  <h3>INFORMAL + FRIENDLY DISCUSSIONS</h3>

  	  	  <p>
  	  	    	My well wishers, peers, friends, researchers, geeks, from the communities gave me valuable - life saving
  	  	    	suggestions, which made me think over about myself and my current practice. <b>Shrinivasan</b> advised
  	  	    	me start a company and consult stuff based upon my skill set. People have literally scolded me to write
  	  	    	a blog or have a vlog for years, and i believe i hade this time.. :D. This time i thought i would talk
  	  	    	less and listen more, but situations made me speak with folks around me and sometimes even dominating
  	  	    	derailing myself from the listening mode.
  	  	  </p>

  	  	  <p>
  	  	    	I do found some of my attitudes that are passively dominating which i am working on it. Moreover,
  	  	    	each discussion appended to my cognitive dissonance, which is already stretching itself out of the white
  	  	    	box. I think i could manage dissonance and practicing less and less procrastination than ever.
  	  	  </p>

  	  	  <p>
  	  	    	I know what u are still expecting.... i cannot share those stuff we discussed with u...
  	  	  </p>

  	  	  <h3>WHAT I LEARNED ?</h3>

  	  	  <p>
  	  	    	A loooooooooot. Lot of stuff about technology, techno-politics, information-politics, socio-technical interfaces
  	  	    	and frictions emerging out of it, social mobilization, alternative infrastructures, about design stuff,
  	  	    	about demonitization - its usage as a <b>"katana slash"</b> by the government - and got more confident about
  	  	    	my thought. I have met a lot of elders who have been doing research as their profession, and now pursuing
  	  	    	their love/passion in free software and allied systems. Conversed with people from other states in different
  	  	    	languages like Telugu (i can speak a little and could understand), wherever and whenever possible. Tasted
  	  	    	great and awesome phone by the way.
  	  	  </p>

			<figure>
		  	  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/comics/meetup-4ccon/books-toomany.png" alt="what i learned">
	  	  	</figure>

  	  	  <p>
  	  	    	Slept relatively more than the volunteers and relatively less than the remaining peers :D. Observed, that still
  	  	    	the communities have to engage a lot more women participation and encourage their influx, to neutralize male
  	  	    	domination. In both the cultural session, i have seen equal pariticpation of male and female artists, where as
  	  	    	in tech. community groups like this, the ratio is not even near to equal. I am pretty sure people are working
  	  	    	towards gender equality in Free Software and similar systems realm. For the past 4 years, atleast, i have seen
  	  	    	a steady raise in women participation, even if it is not as much as male pariticipation. Folks i feel, that
  	  	    	this thing has to be seriously acted upon. Correct me if i am wrong about the view... :). I am still not convinced
  	  	    	for i have missed the <b>Women in Technology</b> session. However, my dear friend, <b>Sohom</b> was
			one of the few men who attended the session. I like to learn from his observation soon... :)
  	  	  </p>

  	  	  <p>
  	  	    	I also found people discussing innovative ways to engage people to increase the participation apart from
  	  	    	conventional forms like starting GLUGS, arranging workshops, organizing camps, etc... which i personally feel a
  	  	    	better step towards propagating the views and philosophy of this great community to a wider public. I also
  	  	    	hope that we shall intervene through more civic participation on policy research and against draconian acts.
  	  	    	We cannot only code and change the system, we have to act physically and critically. One thing i am pretty
  	  	    	sure is that lot of folks who attended this conference, would have a better view of the world they thrive in &
  	  	    	would have realized how invisible laws, policies, systems have influenced their life till now. Those who have
  	  	    	that sparkle mind opening experience, would look far more deeper and wider than ever before.
