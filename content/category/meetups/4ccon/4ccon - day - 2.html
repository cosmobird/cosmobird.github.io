	  	  	  	Whatever happened in DAY-1 morning - similar thing happened again in routine. After overcoming those, had an awesome
	  	  	  	breakfast and met all awesome people from neighbouring states and districts - discussing about the speech &
	  	  	  	discussion sessions. I have even tried speaking to new people whom i never know of... and it is kind of fun to do
	  	  	  	that !... :)

			  	To my surprise, the schedule listed <b><i>Dr.Usha Ramanathan</i></b> in a panel discussion with <b><i>Thomas Franco</i></b>,
			  	<b><i>Srikanth L</i></b>, <b><i>Govinda Rao</i></b> & <b><i>Sharad Sharma</i></b> about Demonitization & Digital Infrastructure. I
			  	never expected her presence for the day. She is one of the key person that inspired me to think about stuff from different
			  	point of view. I have even read the book <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2P66bYnyzH7em15Q2preDJObEU">
			  	Wages of Impunity by K.G. Kannabiran</a> suggested by her few years ago, which gave me a further wider view of the situation of this
			  	country - its police, legislative, bureaucratic system, constitution, people & democracy by shedding new lights... on my
			  	interpreation & better understanding of Constitution and Systems.

				    <div id="accordion-1" class="accordion-section-content">
					<p>
					  	Every session arranged is critical, and so i literally lost my opportunity to speak with <b><i>P.Sainath</i></b>, who did
					  	inspired my life in some way. But interestingly, i attended <b>Smart governance</b> handled by Srikanth Lakshmanan. We had
					  	good discussion about :
					  	<ul>
					  	  <li>E-governance</li>
					  	  <li>FAT in e-governance & its projects</li>
					  	  <li>Open-Data, gov. Open source policies</li>
					  	  <li>Aadhaar/UIDAI & UPI/India Stack based services</li>
					  	  <li>Open-government projects hosted in <a href="https://openforge.gov.in/">Open Forge</a></li>
					  	</ul>
					</p>

					<p>
					  	I personally have handed him a research query, which i am still waiting the answers for. I hope i would soon get his
					  	replies back. After so much pressure and almost 5 years of disobedience against Aadhar's <b>"Voluntarily Mandatory"</b>
					  	strategy, i had to enroll Aadhar for want of PDS - Food cornered by my present <b>Independent Research</b> situation.
					  	I am still happy to know that people like Srikanth are still do say <b>NO or NOT necessary</b> to Aadhaar. I hope that
					  	he does not fall into situations that mandates him to the gravity of enrolling of draconian Aadhaar scheme.

				    <a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-2"><h3>→ Afternoon Session</h3></a>
				    <div id="accordion-2" class="accordion-section-content">
					<p>
						This is the more interesting experience i have ever had in the conference. This is the kind of experience i was searching
					  	for. The session is about introducing IndiaStacks to communities like us. At first me and my peer.. was a bit skeptical
					  	in attending the session, but then we decided to learn <b><i>Sharad Sharma</i></b>'s point of view. During his presentation
					  	many of the points he pointed out as "public reasons" were contradictory to us. His interpretation seems to be founted
					  	& stemmed from the Silicon Valley, and rooted in pushing disruption and was felt it was never really about enabling and
					  	embracing local scenario. Even though his flamboyant presentation slides contain inclusion of "common man" scenario, the
					  	reasoning are completely out of scope. His interpretations of current scenario are in alignment with <b>commodification
						of privacy</b> using Aadhaar + UPI + IndiaStack for the sake of better facilitation.
					</p>

					<p>
					  	<b>Sharad Sharma's point is :</b> before any other MNC or conglomerate would commodify your privacy legally, why not people let
					  	the government - private partnership within the nation do it ???. After all, government functionality nowadays are focussed
					  	more towards profit orientation rather than directive principles of state policy. So its either them or the big corporations.
					  	And as long as Aadhaar, UPI, and layers like IndiaStack are present, they will not let the potential market slip out of our hands.
					  	So people have no choice after demonitization, let everyone have a smartphone (even people who are BPL), even by pushing majority
					  	of the population to buy one, without worrying about the proverty, so that we can unitedly prove Aadhaar, UPI, IndiaStack are the
					  	fore front in governance technology.... that aspires to solve the problems in economy, governance, bureaucracy in one go. But
					  	to safegaurd the technology against attacks they will not be transparent to people, not even transparent about the locations
					  	of Aadhar data centres properly, open-source development method will not be adopted and people are there to just shut their
					  	critical thinking, cripple their civic rights, fill their mouths with burgers, to just accept what these systems are pushing
					  	in the name of disruption which will lead to a better society.
					</p>

					<p>
					  	<b>Inference :</b> So.... Congratulations, on confirming that we are no more data-based subjects, but even reduced to toy
					  	objects living just to enable Aadhaar, UPI, IndiaStack services, & to transact digital currencies.... that would further
					  	accelerate consumerism, synthetic internet product purchase addictions, loss of critical understanding of what is privacy
					  	& what is not privacy, reducing democracy to plutocracy and even to monarchy to make "kings" decision without the need to
					  	consult anybody and execute the self made decisions within a day. :D  But still, those "kings decision" have never
					  	thought about implementing free & free of cost education, removing electoral corruptions, participatory governance... ?
					</p>

					<p>
					  	Out of nowehere, he interestingly pulled whistle blower: <b>Edward Snowden</b> and made personal attacks on him without any
					  	proper proof. We both confronted this and then onwards he was completely ignoring our impetus and request to raise queries
					  	regarding architecture of IndiaStack and even i have had questions to him from a developmental economics point of view.
					  	Fortunately some of the other peers, who were still sane, asked him really proper questions in association with <b>open-source</b>
					  	policy of India Stack. Now the discussion so hot, that he too emotional, and started comparing hollywood movie industry
					  	policies with the governance here. He futher erupted emotionally and refuted the query with unnecessarily stench words, that
					  	would have hurt any person who have expected politeness and proper reasoning for a humble question. The guy who queried Sharad
					  	Sharma literally never expected such word flames....
					</p>

					<p>
					  	<b>Interesting eh ???</b> All these time, me and my peer do not know that <b>Usha Ramanathan</b> was sitting beside us and
					  	was listening to all these commotions happening in the hall. After recognizing that she is in the hall, i decided to go speak
					  	about law research, aadhaar, wages of impunity, stuff as we are moving towards the panel discussion in the auditorium which
					  	i was eagerly waiting for it till morning. As of then i was expecting a really good rational discussion in the panel maintaining
					  	they coool.
					</p>

					<p>
					  	<b>(but deep down ... i was expecting something different)</b>

					<p>
						The panel discussion started after me having little talks with Usha Ramanathan and Franco Thomas. Panel was set and initiated
					  	by Thomas Franco about demonitization & digital infrastructure. Again all speakers were rationally explaining their views
					  	while Sharad Sharma took emotion as his strategy, and resembled the Charlie Chaplin's climax speech profile in "The Great dictator",
					  	expect that this views sound subjugative atleast for few of us. Do not assume that he made a great speech just because i have
					  	compared his speech profile with Charlie Chaplin's.... <b>Beware :D</b>

					<p>
					  	With good points made by all, the session ended peacefully in a progressive way - while everyone not accepting specific views of
					  	Sharad Sharma - and made it clear to the public attending the session through their gestures, which unfortunately Sharad Sharma
					  	would not have possibly seen. Those who have understood little bit of liberty, democracy, constituion, and the present state of
					  	the system, gave <b>standing ovation</b> to Usha Ramanathan and Thomas Franco. We are neither driven by emotion, nor by overhonorary
					  	but the ovation emerged out of us, spontaneously, that helped made the situation clear on how the dots are connected with opportunistic
					  	mindset. I believe that those who appreciated it, has certain degree of criticality to it.
					</p>

					<p>
					  	Panel concluded with that the Financial institutions, Governance, Bureaucracy can function in a much better way with empathy and
					  	not by robbing/alienating people by pushing them to a new infrastructure that has many problems and most of the part was
					  	infused in practice in unconstitutional way ! (aadhaar as money bill and first implemented before even passing the bill... moreover
					  	a republic government must look forward to create act if there is need for written privacy law in constitution - instead the governments
					  	we chose, are using it as a business pot to churn out profits and control mechanisms...).

					  	I never thought, that volunteers would arrange <b>Thappattam (தப்பாட்டம்)</b> from my home district. I love two folk
					  	arts very deeply. One is <b>Devarattam (தேவராட்டம்)</b> that uses <b>Thunthubi (துந்துபி)</b>, and the other is thappattam,
					  	that almost mesmerizes anybody in TamilNadu. And this time, it has proved that it has proved its artistic influx
					  	into almost everyone who came to the auditorium (which is a diverse mix of people with diverse cultures & languages).
					  	I didn't danced, instead i was crying altogether, as a form of expression and was keenly observing the dance, their leg,
					  	hand, instrument movements, graceness, etc,..... I was crying for a long time (basically i do not know why i cried).
					  	I hope everybody would have enjoyed <b>celebration of life</b> from the music and flamboyant performance of the artists.

					  	Aftern reaching hoste, me and prasanna decided to engage new volunteers, and all others in the surrounding to help them
					  	learn about the necessity of <b>alternative thinking</b> in social, techno-social, techno-political domains, that gave
					  	prasanna to start the discussion with querying about the each ones understanding on centralized, decnetralized, grassroots
					  	based systems - atleast in social networking point of view. We both along with others in the room seemed to attact towards
					  	a critical discussion about the architectural influence of networking technology in communication, social reflection, etc..
					  	The discussion went so long and interesting at some point we simulated situations of centralized social networking and people
					  	seem to kindle their thought process and thought really about the advantages and limitations of the system.
					</p>

					<p>
					  	We then replicated similar simulation strategy for other structural/architectural modes of networking namely, decentralized/
					  	federated and grass-roots networking. People tend to clearly understand where architecure comes in, where structure emerges,
					  	how they both influences information flow, what founted data commodification, etc... from unbiased view as much as we
					  	capable of handling. It is like my brain took a trip in <b>Psilocybin</b> by just taking part in the disucssion alone. We have
					  	not only deliberated about the advantages and limitations of each systems and ideas, but tend to come to certain conclusions
					  	of where to use what.... in other words... location based implementation <b>+</b> scenario (anti-ignorance) based implementation.
					</p>

					<p>
					  	We felt that such deliberation is necessary because, these are the technology which are going to emerge as alternatives to
					  	present communication infrastructure which has to be shaped towards a progressive functionality rather than a profit yielding
					  	functionality alone. It happened in a democratic way apart from sporadic heated arguments over unproved claims.
