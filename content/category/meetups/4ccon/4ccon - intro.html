  	  	<p>Hey there <b>!</b></p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>DISCLIAMER :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Hey folks, i am just expressing my view of awesome <a href="https://4ccon.fsmi.in/">4CCON conference</a>
  	  	  	that i experienced by being a part of the conference volunteer and workshop speaker. I neither endorse
  	  	  	nor express any objective view. The following incidents were totally of my fun and stuff that happened
  	  	  	in the national meetup.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>INTRO :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	So, being around with communities like FSFTN, FSMK, FSHM atleast for a few years and having a huge
  	  	  	set of awesome peers and friends, i know to a certain extent how these dudes work during a public event
  	  	  	like this. Atleast, i have been part in some other events, which was organized locally in some
  	  	  	districts of TamilNadu, Karnataka. The volunteers who worked in 4CCON, behind the banner designs, who worked
  	  	  	behind catering food, who involved in accomodation of huge volunteer density, who involved in arranging
  	  	  	technical workshops(even in chaos), who took pain in coinvincing university staff that requires tight and
  	  	  	right at the edge planning & execution, who designed & coded the awesome website, who involved in handling
  	  	  	the workshops, who helped take videos the conference, arrange live updates, creating news cast... and most
  	  	  	of the other folks who run here and there without ever knowing why they even actually running and doing things...
  	  	</p>

	  	  	  	<figcaption><b><i>EVERYONE OF THEM DESERVE A STANDING OVATION</i></b></figcaption>
  	  		</figure>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	and by the way, there are folks like me, who go there, eat food, free load stuff, observe people, involve
  	  	  	in discussion, hang around people, raise questions.... you know doing stuff the humans do in a group... :)
  	  	  	in short we are the psychedelics of the conference, who keep the groups relaxed, tensed, fun, and so on...
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Did i mentioned ? the conference is not only about propagating free/open source software & hardware, policies,
  	  	  	philosophies, practicies, tools & sharing knowledge stuff... this time it has marked a significant step
  	  	  	towards a social progression, through active civic participation & democratic policy intervention which as a
  	  	  	social movement people tirelessly involved since its inception 6 years ago !
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>MY PLANNING :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
			I have registered for the conference to handle a workshop on GIS, to share my learning and experiences,
  	  		workflow with peers who are interested and liked to share similar stuff. I have registered atleast a
  	  		month early. That gave me a pretty much wider bandwidth to think about the workshop, and accomodated
  	  		stuff into a LaTeX based presentation from my notes, block diagrams, screenshots, drawings... u know.
  	  		In the process i assumed that the workshop would be scheduled for 4 days, and so i have been mentally
  	  		preparing and organizing the content and content delivery. (U know assumptions are the seed of all fuckups !)
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
			One fine day, one of the organizer, from FSFTN telephoned me regarding something which i dont remember about, and in
  	  	  	the conversation, he informed that the workshop will all be held in one day...! That is all, enough for
  	  	  	me to put my congnition regarding conference in jeopardy.... and have decided to cramp all the 70+ slides
  	  	  	within a day.... ! Lets see how it goes....
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Basically my planning was resetted and i have to go adhoc !, which will be interesting to handle.... :D
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>ME TRAVELLING :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	This is during while almost all youth and people were confused about, thinking, contemplating, critically processing
  	  	  	their decisions, emotionally acting, democratically protesting for <b>Jallikattu</b>. Just a day or two before
  	  	  	starting my journey for the cornference, two delegates from FSMK were travelling from Bangalore, to Chennai, by
  	  	  	train via Katpadi, which is when political intervention resulted in their train held up without any
  	  	  	further announcement. One of my friend telephoned me, when i fortunately picked and asked me to help them out...
		</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Even with all commotion happening in chennai, people from other districts, other states have accumulated in
  	  	  	Chennai, and volunteering seriously for atleast a month afaik.

	  	  	  	<figcaption><b>some of the core volunteers in FSFTN office, Chennai</b></figcaption>
  	  		</figure>
		</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	    	It is a photo pic, showing some of the core volunteers discussing about the even management stuff.... :)
  	  	    	Don't even think... i was not there when this happened...
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	We had good time, during their stay over in my home... and helped them travel to Chennai next day morning via bus.
  	  	  	Then comes my turn, and after finishing some of the works in home, and taking leave from my home duty, i travelled
  	  	  	to Chennai from Vellore 25th morning, helped arranging some stuff, getting to know new people, starting having fun,
  	  	  	travelled via train to the station along with other coooool peers and finally reached destination - our venue.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>OUR VENUE :</i></h3></p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Our venue is renowned B.S. Abdur Rahman University, Tambaram, Chennai. We locals know it as Crescent Engineering College.
  	  	  	And the venue is situated near Vandaloor Zoo, which is very near and adjacent to the Vandaloor hill. So the elevation is
  	  	  	typically high than in other areas of Chennai on average. However, the most important thing not many of us are
  	  	  	aware of is, that the whole area is renowned for its bird diversity and density... So naturally, sometimes, i mean
  	  	  	sometimes - but not often - if i can exaggerate - shit shower might occur ....
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	   ha ha ha :). Yes you heard me right !
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	   	If one is ready to listen and observe closely, i am sure, u can <b>appreaciate the biodiversity, and health of forest
  	  	  	and venue mulched with bird droppings</b>. It is a great place to hang around, and the university is situated right in
  	  	  	center with broad, tall, huge, departmental buildings which i have never witnessed in my school or college days ! Coooool.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p><h3><i>WHO AM I ?</i></h3></p>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  	As usual, i was helping around with some of other peers in volunteer group. Yet i still do not know whether i am a
  	  	  	volunteer, a speaker for workshop or a delegate or a individual..... I was literally in confusion how should i
  	  	  	react to people's expectation. Then as i usually would do, mixed with the flow and became part of the group :).
  	  	  	By the time, volunteers who were organizing accomodation for huge inflow of volunteers and delegates from FSMK,
  	  	  	FSHM, Swecha, DAKF, folks from westbengal, and other states, - were under huge pressure to organize rooms in university
  	  	  	hostel, including arranging beds and stuff. Literally, people were contacting nearby colleges to accomodate huge
  	  	  	barrier breaking influx of people.... and believe me this stuff is tough to do !!!... i never even dared to try...
  	  	</p>
