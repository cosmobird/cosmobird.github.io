	  	  		After reaching the venue by evening, many of the local and neighbour state delegates
	  	  	  	were working on their volunteered responsibility and filled the emptiness wherever
	  	  	  	their service is needed. I on the other hand, hanged around with prasanna from FSHM,
	  	  	  	discussing about philosophy stuff, and sharing his own volunteered work of organizing
	  	  	  	the technical workshops in terms of dividing the volunteers to speakers, allocating
	  	  	  	rooms & their keys, by coordinating with the hall organization team - who literally
	  	  	  	has to bang their heads to get the information about the availabiility of halls.
			</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	In the mean time, we volunteers (yeah now i am in volunteer mode), gathered to
	  	  	  	organize by taking responsibilities, and sharing contacts of a experienced
	  	  	  	volunteer in a flat group fashion for more flexibility if not for efficiency. By the
	  	  	  	end of the meeting we had all other volunteers contact no.'s and handles that helped
	  	  	  	us organize ourselves.
	  	  	</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	By the end of the session some of us were addressing new volunteers about 4CCON, philosophy,
	  	  	  	practice, and so on stuff... Then we had wonderful moonlight dinner which we almost shared
	  	  	  	plates and felt a commune cooking experience.... :) I can still remember the taste of curry
	  	  	  	and rasam which i have packed in my PET bottle and drinking it often... like water :D
	  	  	</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	This process crossed mid-night, and till most of the work were chaotic and adhoc,
	  	  	  	without any proper procedure. I was startled to see that people emerge on their own
	  	  	  	taking the functionality that are floating around, and tried to complete as much as
	  	  	  	possible. I being as a speaker, fortunately relieved from workshop stuff - as i have
	  	  	  	prepared all the resources needed. That gave me window to help breathe the venue
	  	  	  	organization stuff. I learned hell looooooot of stuff practically about event
	  	  	  	organization, timing, resource management, as well as interesting group dynamics.
	  	  	</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	Now the second great challenge is, i have to handle the workshop session, with perfect
	  	  	  	combination of sleep deprivation and with no mental preparation of handling
	  	  	  	diverse peers who registered for my <b>GIS from & for commons</b> workshop. It is so
	  	  	  	fortunate to know that the total <b>no.</b> of registration was <b>â‰Œ  0</b>. I kind of felt
	  	  	  	much relieved, to handle probably only less no. of students - i hoped.
	  	  	</p>

	  	  	<p>
	  	  	  	I can feel Entropy is in rise .... emerging from the group dynamics... awesome
