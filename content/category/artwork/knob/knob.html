		<h2> The Knob </h2>
	</header>

  	<div class="content">

  	  	<p>hi there,</p>

		<p>
		  	This is just a knob - a virtual one, made using <a href="https://inkscape.org/"> Inkscape. </a>
		</p>

		<p>
		  	I have used instruments in laboratories like oscilloscopes and function generators and played with them for
			significant part of my life so far.
		</p>

		<p>
			With the rise of Human Machine Interfaces, there is still a unfilled necessity of a good widget library that
			could satisfy the requirements for engineers of instrumentation, communication, students, researchers, who
			would like to keep their hands dirty :).
		</p>

		<p>
			I have long been thinking about an alternative for proprietary software tools which target these scientifically
			rich community. One must see, that a set of research community needs instruments with essential controls and
			output interfaces. When these proprietary tools offer such a convenience as a packages, these morons are sincerely
		  	ignorant their liberty - even with their scientific temper - could not think straight, fell for mumbo jumbo
		  	marketing, agreeing the terms and conditions, purchase em out of peoples hard earned tax money & promote these
		  	packages.
		</p>

		<p>
			Sincerely, i do not know what these "scientists" and their "engineers & interns" are capable of doing, while
			they cannot create stuff for their own requirements, and propagate its process of creation & its use among
		  	their peers in the community.
		</p>

		<p>
			Being said that, i know that it is also a significant part of them who do support and accelerate open access,
		  	free(not free of cost! i.e, free as in liberty/freedom) systems, information dissemination by design,
		  	collaboration - and have created significant contributions in the fields like, geosciences, operating systems,
		  	mathematics, computation and simulation systems. Honestly, when i learn about them, i feel so so so awesome.
		</p>

		<p>
			With the shift towards open technologies, symbiotic networks between disciplines - still not much contribution
			towards satisfying the needs of such community. It has to be not only for the such people alone but for commons
			in common. I am not saying that it has to be pushed as institutionalized policies and establishing mechanisms,
		  	but some emergence has to be built upon. Not all of us are programmers, designers, researchers... still, necessity
		  	is necessity, we shall not make it the slightest mistake to honour it as elitist luxury resource - that could be
		  	accessed by heavily funded and moron minded scientists & engineers - who are no better than clergymen.
		</p>

  	  	<p>
			In such a path of emerging contribution, i consider this tiny teeny project is a small contribution towards it.
  	  	</p>

			So, here is the Knob...

		  <figure class="content-image">
		  	<img src="../../../../content/resource/illustrations/Knob/Knob.png" alt="Knob">
		  </figure>

		<p>
			As you see it nicely fits and matches this light grey background.... ! Imagine the same kind of stuff, that can
			fit a particular projects needs, like sliders, graphs & plots - it will really look "geeky"... you know what i
			mean ??
		</p>

		<p>
			I have made this knob, with impetus of using this passive svg's to use as a widget in the widget collection
			library by using the svg straitly or atleast reuse the design flow in the vala code for GTK-GNOME based applications.
			Moreover, i desire to have a really good technical widget collection with GNOME stack.

	   	| Imbecile, i dont want to fill this page with  |
		| all microsteps involved, let em take the file |
		| and play with it.... !			|
		| i am lazy and i am not a fucking tutor...	|
		| i just share share stuff... a fellow sharer ! |

		<p>
		  	  Ummm.. people, i believe that the raw svg file can be used with some
		  	  animation library that recognizes svg objects... for example :

				<ul>
				  <li><a href="http://snapsvg.io/"> Snap svg library </a></li>
				  <li><a href="https://www.cairographics.org">Cairo graphics library</a></li>
				</ul>
