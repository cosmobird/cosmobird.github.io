hi there,

	This is a System Monitor based design which i made using Inkscape & Conky.
	The UI design is only one way as usual in conky. However, the design basically
	reflects my curiosity towards polygonization of surfaces. Particularly the mesh
	generation, voronoi & delaunay patterns used in spatial analysis & statistics
	have inspired me in a geometric and artistic sense.

	I am also interested in learning how the reporters (hardware sensors + programmed
	functions) that monitor vital system status. Particularly learned something
	around Lua & C. Really appreciable stuff.

	With such curiosity, and knowing very little about the above stuff, i somehow
	managed to make the conky system monitor work in my screen. Much of the web is
	mostly filled with some popular designs for Conky.

	It is very great that using free software like Conky, its derived designs are
	rapidly copied and redistributed with little bit of customization a user immediately
	wants to enjoy it. But it is also its very nature is to easily customize its
	operation, look, feel that brings the individuality in oneself. I consider that
	as a great value for liberty, helps gain confidence on one's own hacking, brings
	courage to write some program. The individual becomes their own critical reviewer...
	because it brings a personal touch and help get started with introspection.

	:)

	Searched for immediate availability of polygon generation - none is good, moreover,
	not available as free/open tool. Somehow pattern generation plugin in Inkscape is not
	much helpful during that time (how ever they are good at generating voronoi, delaunay
	polygons...)
