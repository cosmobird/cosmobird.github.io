		 hi there,
		 </p>

  	  	<p>
		 	This is a System Monitor based design which i made using <a href="https://inkscape.org/">
			Inkscape </a> & <a href="https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky"> Conky. </a>
		</p>

  	  	<p>
	  	  	The UI design is only one way as usual in conky. However, the design basically reflects my curiosity towards
			polygonization of surfaces. Particularly the mesh generation, voronoi & delaunay patterns used in spatial
			analysis & statistics have inspired me in a geometric and artistic sense.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
			I am also interested in learning how the reporters (hardware sensors + programmed functions) that monitor
		  	vital system status. Particularly learned something around Lua & C. Really appreciable stuff.
  	  	</p>

	  	<p>
			Take a look at the design... I know it is tooooo colory... now i have a completely different desktop in my
		  	GNU box... :D
	  	</p>

		  </figure>


		<p>
			With such curiosity, and knowing very little about the above stuff, i somehow managed to make the conky
			system monitor work in my screen. Much of the web is mostly filled with some popular designs for Conky.

		<p>
			It is very great that using free software like Conky, its derived designs are rapidly copied and redistributed
			with little bit of customization a user immediately wants to enjoy it. But it is also its very nature is to
			easily customize its operation, look, feel that brings the individuality in oneself. I consider that as a great
			value for liberty, helps gain confidence on one's own hacking, brings courage to write some program. The individual
			becomes their own critical reviewer... because it brings a personal touch and help get started with introspection.

			Searched for immediate availability of polygon generation - none is good, moreover, not available as free/open tool.
			Somehow pattern generation plugin in Inkscape is not much helpful for me - to suit my train of thoughts while
			designing it.. how ever it is good at generating : polygons...).

			<a href="http://goinkscape.com/author/aanieze/"> Aaron Nieze </a> for his simple and nice tutorial

			I have learned much from his tutorial collection... :D

	+-----------------------------------------------+

		  +--------------------------------------------------+----( me )
		  | Its pretty inspiring for me, & furthermore, its  |
		  | kickass, and never crashed once till i used it.  |
		  | Furthermore, it never spied me to some shitty    |
		  | service out there...			     |

			<b><i>Now, how did i draw that stuff in Inkscape ???</i></b>
		</p>

		<p>
			All small polygons that you are seeing in the bar, are hand drawn during my procrastination. Learned how to draw
			a set of polygons for filling the space, and definetly a machine when programmed or taught to do that function
			is always wise. Remember Inkscape has inbuilt functions to do that !
		</p>

		<p>
			Instead of me going through all the stages of drawing an illustration in inkscape and filling up this page, feel
			free to download from the link provided below and learn.
