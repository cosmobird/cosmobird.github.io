hi there,

	This is a System Monitor based design which i made using <a href="https://inkscape.org/"> Inkscape </a> & <a href="https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky"> Conky. </a>
	The UI design is only one way as usual in conky. However, the design basically
	reflects my curiosity towards polygonization of surfaces. Particularly the mesh
	generation, voronoi & delaunay patterns used in spatial analysis & statistics
	have inspired me in a geometric and artistic sense.

	I am also interested in learning how the reporters (hardware sensors + programmed
	functions) that monitor vital system status. Particularly learned something
	around Lua & C. Really appreciable stuff.

  	Take a look at the design... I know it is tooooo colory... now i have a completely
  	different desktop in my GNU box... :D

	  	<img  src="../../../content/resource/illustrations/Polygon Bar Screenshot.png" alt="polygon-bar-desktop">
	  </figure>
  		<pre>

	With such curiosity, and knowing very little about the above stuff, i somehow
	managed to make the conky system monitor work in my screen. Much of the web is
	mostly filled with some popular designs for Conky.

			+-------------------------------------------------+

	It is very great that using free software like Conky, its derived designs are
	rapidly copied and redistributed with little bit of customization a user immediately
	wants to enjoy it. But it is also its very nature is to easily customize its
	operation, look, feel that brings the individuality in oneself. I consider that
	as a great value for liberty, helps gain confidence on one's own hacking, brings
	courage to write some program. The individual becomes their own critical reviewer...
	because it brings a personal touch and help get started with introspection.

	:)

	Searched for immediate availability of polygon generation - none is good, moreover,
	not available as free/open tool. Somehow pattern generation plugin in Inkscape is not
	much helpful for me - to suit my train of thoughts while designing it.. (how ever they
  	are good at generating :

  		  1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram"> voronoi </a>

  		  2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation"> delaunay </a>

	polygons...)

		<bud>/ \</bud>     | hmmmmh... Whatever! by the way who uses these |
  			| stuff nowadays, probably nerds like you ???   |
			+-----------------------------------------------+

  		  		   +--------------------------------------------------+---- ( me )
  		  		   | Its pretty inspiring for me, & furthermore, its  |
  		  		   | kickass, and never crashed once till i used it.  |
  		  		   | Furthermore, it never spied me to some shitty    |
  		  		   | service out there...			      |
  		  		   +--------------------------------------------------+

  	Now, how did i draw that stuff in Inkscape ???

  	All small polygons that you are seeing in the bar, are hand drawn during my procrastination.
  	Learned how to draw a set of polygons for filling the space, and definetly a machine when
  	programmed or taught to do that function is always wise. Remember Inkscape has inbuilt functions
  	to do that !

  	Instead of me going through all the stages of drawing an illustration in inkscape and filling up
  	this page, feel free to download from the link provided below and learn.
