hi there,

	This is just a knob - a virtual one, made using <a href="https://inkscape.org/"> Inkscape. </a>

	I have used instruments in laboratories like oscilloscopes and function generators and
	played with them for significant part of my life so far.

	With the rise of Human Machine Interfaces, there is still a good widget library that
	could satisfy the requirements for engineers of instrumentation, communication, students,
	researchers, who would like to keep their hands dirty :).

	I have long been thinking about an alternative for proprietary software tools which target
	these scientifically rich community. One must see, that a set of research community needs
	instruments with essential controls and output interfaces. When these proprietary tools
  	offer such a convenience as a packages, these morons who do not value their liberty - even
  	with their scientific temper - could not think straight, fell for it, agrees the terms and
	conditions, purchase em out of peoples hard earned tax money & promote these packages.

	Sincerely, i do not know what these "scientists" and their "engineers & interns" are
	capable of doing, while they cannot create stuff for their own requirements, and propagate
	its use among their communities.

	Being said that, i know that it is also them who support and accelerate open access, free
	software, information dissemination by design, collaboration - and have created significant
	contributions in the fields like, geosciences, operating systems, mathematics, computation
  	and simulation systems. Honestly, when i learn about them, i feel so so so awesome.

	With the shift towards open technologies, symbiotic networks between disciplines - still not
	much contribution towards satisfying the needs of such community. It has to be not only for
	the such people alone but for commons in common. I am not saying that it has to be pushed
  	as institutionalized mechanisms but some emergence has to be built upon. Not all of us are
  	programmers, designers, researchers... still, necessity is necessity, we shall not make it
	the slightest mistake to honour it as elitist luxury accessible by moron scientists &
  	engineers.

  	In such a path of emerging contribution, i consider this tiny teeny project is a small
	contribution towards it.

	As you see it nicely fits and matches this dark grey background.... !
	Imagine the same kind of stuff, that can fit a particular projects needs,
	like sliders, graphs & plots - it will really look "geeky"... you know what i mean ??

	I have made this knob, with impetus of using this passive svg's to use as a
	widget in the widget collection library by using the svg straitly or atleast reuse
	the design flow in the vala code for GTK-GNOME based applications. Moreover, i desire
	to have a really good technical widget collection with GNOME stack.

	  	  Ummm.. people, i believe that the raw svg file can be used with some
	  	  animation library that recognizes svg objects... for example :
