		<h2> How about making a comic strip ? </h2>
	</header>

  	<div class="content">

  	  	<p>yo interested in comics like me ?</p>

		<p>
		  	For some years now, i have been thinking about having a vector drawing tool that help one to create a comic
		  	strip, atleast that has more functionality than	the traditional workflow. Obviously
		  	<a href="https://inkscape.org/"> Inkscape </a> being the one i have been using for long as i known came to
		  	mind.
		</p>

		<p>
		  	Being said that, i am a firm believer of <b>Paper, Pencil, Eraser</b> workflow & later transforming into
		  	digital space using simple scan, gimp, inkscape or mypaint workflow. I learned a lot about inkscape via this
		  	workflow. :)
		</p>

		<p>
			For so long i have been just an explorer of comics, broadly ranging from cave drawing, to traditional type, to
		  	classical to western, to japanese forms -- who have never even thought about learning its grammar, mechanisms,
		  	history, present state, its diversity.... etc.
		</p>

  	  	<p>
			I also believe that there is some degree of artist in every person and so hacker is no different to that. It is
  	  	  	very much evident with technological evolution and revolutions, FOSS tools have empowered every known hacker and
  	  	  	especially commons to create and share awesome <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme"> memes. </a> We all do
  	  	  	know that it has emerged as a by-product of socio-technical situations. Obviously like every humour, it might
  	  	  	root its origins in non-neglectable dark corners of crazy anthropolocial activity. i see memes are fractal forces
  	  	  	in todays socio-techno-cultural network ecosystem.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	I am one of those folks who born duing mid 1980's and have seen crazy flamboyant and awful transitions humanity
  	  	  	has travelled that brought us into current situations. I have witnessed commodification of Water, Soil, Seed,
  	  	  	fungus & algae... ; commodification of freely travelling electromagnetic waves; birth, raise and life of Internet,
  	  	  	Hacker culture, ... so on. I'm one of the kids who have grown up enjoying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Jack">
			Samurai Jack </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Planet_and_the_Planeteers">Captain Planet</a>, &
  	  	  	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Adventures_of_Jonny_Quest"> Jonny Quest </a>
		</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	While traveling in internet, me particularly heavily inspired by :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li><a href="http://www.sidewalkbubblegum.com/category/comics-about-the-media/"> Side Walk Bubblegum </a></li>
  	  	  	  <li><a href=""> XKCD </a></li>
  	  	  	  <li><a href=""> PHD comics </a></li>
  	  	  	</ul>

  	  	  	 (<i>because i got lot time to read them in national laboratory i was working at</i> <b>:)..</b> ).
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
			Around <b><i>2011-2012</i></b>, i learnt :

  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li>how <b>UNJUST LAWs</b> can <a href="http://muftah.org/aseem-trivedi-cartoonists-fight-corruption-censorship-intolerance/">
				 oppress, subjugate & criminalize </a> <a href="http://www.aseemtrivedi.in/p/about.html">
  	  	  	  	independent artists </a> to freely express their views</li>
  	  	  	  <li>how media empires can impose "standards" that are utterly meaningless for art</li>
  	  	  	</ul>

  	  	</p>

			<b><i>So now, how to make a comic with FOSS tools ?</i></b>
		</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  		i follow a straight forward workflow like :

  	  	  	<figcaption><b>Usual Workflow</b></figcaption>

		  	  <li>Introspect & Retrospect understandings of Visual Grammar & Communication</li>
		  	</ul>

			<ul>
			  <li>If you have a story either small or big, go on and try to draw it with
		  		characters that pop in your artistic mind.</li>

			</ul>
		  <li> <h3>STEP 3:</h3> </li>

		  	  <li>Scan the paper <i>(simple scan)</i></li>
		  	  <li>Adjust raster image properties <i>(gimp)</i></li>
		  	  <li>Trace the scanned image into vector graphics <i>(inkscape)</i></li>
		  	  <li>Edit nodes and add required additional paths, symbols</li>
		  	</ul>

		  <li> <h3>STEP 4:</h3> </li>
		  	<ul>
