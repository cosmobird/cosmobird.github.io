  		<h3>DISCLAIMER</h3>
  		<p>
  			I am writing this on my understanding about cooperatives, which i am still learning and exploring to be a part of a cooperative
  			in the locality that would serve for mutual well being as vital goal. Beware of mistakes and erors that i may have mistakenly
  			added to the writeup. I completely welcome suggestion and criticism.
  		</p>

  		<h3>WHAT IS THIS ABOUT ?</h3>
  		<p>
  			Cooperatives have long existed probably before our time now, and will surely exist even after our death. That is a fact. This writeup
  			is not the cooperative that big business form during convergence and conglomeration for the sake for maximizing profit, deepening
  			power establishment, exploitation, etc... This is about who a bunch of individuals of similar thought process, ideas, skill sets, can
  			mutually agree upon a fundamental set of concrete principles that does not leverage on competition and profit theories, but on mutual
  			wellbeing, reciprocity, collaboration, sharing, transparency, education, social solidarity, etc...
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			However, i am not going to discuss with you about what cooperatives are, its theory, etc... and a generic historical awareness can
  			be provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_cooperative_movement">wikipedia page</a>. What i am going to discuss
  			is how individuals and their networks could form a effective cooperative with whay they have in hand. In the era of Information &
  			Communication technology, form of goods and services are shifting rapidly from physical realm to digital realm. What i have learned is
  			Cooperative philosophy does not provide you a set of success formulas that pushes you in to the sea of hurricanes of business competition,
  			and expect you to succeed, so that a new formula would arise out of your effort. What it provides is a basic set of principles and
  			guidelines that evolves from pragmatic understanding how we human beings can really live as social beings by not falling into the trap
  			of competition and greed.
  		</p>

  		<h3>WHAT IF ?</h3>
  		<p>
  			Wherever i see now, there is a community for everything. Not more than 10 years ago, there is barely a community and even if it is there
  			it would be around a set of philosophical background and basically serve mutual learning platform - which we usually term as clubs.
  			Fast forward 10 years, there is literally a community for every programming language, every technological framework, for every skill.
			This is the case in Urban places, where as in rural areas it is still challenging to have a community apart from local administrative councils.
  			Communities are becoming the great place of knowledge sharing that spans from technological issues to political issues. People in communities
  			have more networked awareness about things that are happening around, atleast got a mindset to filter out the noise that we are constantly
  			bogged down with.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			What if these Networked individuals, who are already grouped together either for sharing knowledge or actively involved in addresing social issues,
  			-- could use their skills, tools, knowledge to evolve from communities to <b>networked community-cooperatives</b> ?

  			<ul>
  				<li>What if they can use the collective effort to address social issues more effectively ?</li>
  				<li>What if such effort enable them to sustain themselves economically and financially ?</li>
  				<li>What if such a triumph enables them to live independently - off the corporate or paternal bureaucratic systems ?</li>
  				<li>What if they represent the living examples and proofs of alternatives ?</li>
  			</ul>
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Already many communities are successful and stand out as roll models in civil society forms, atleast with the ones i am in touch with.
  			They have even participation at times associated with social issue. What i am seeking is a further evolution in communities that
  			would use individual skillsets and technologies for addressing social issues or to provide a service for marginalized people and sectors,
  			with their collaborative nature.
