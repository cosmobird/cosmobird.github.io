      <p>
  	I am writing this on my understanding about cooperatives, which i am still learning and exploring to be a part of a cooperative
  	in the locality that would serve for mutual well being as vital goal. Beware of mistakes and erors that i may have mistakenly
  	added to the writeup. I completely welcome suggestion and criticism.
      </p>
      
    </div>

    <div class="chapter-header"><span>WHAT IS THIS ABOUT ?</span></div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
  	Cooperatives have long existed probably before our time now, and will surely exist even after our death. That is a fact. This writeup
  	is not the cooperative that big business form during convergence and conglomeration for the sake for maximizing profit, deepening
  	power establishment, exploitation, etc... This is about who a bunch of individuals of similar thought process, ideas, skill sets, can
  	mutually agree upon a fundamental set of concrete principles that does not leverage on competition and profit theories, but on mutual
  	wellbeing, reciprocity, collaboration, sharing, transparency, education, social solidarity, etc...
      </p>

      <p>
  	However, i am not going to discuss with you about what cooperatives are, its theory, etc... and a generic historical awareness can
  	be provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_cooperative_movement">wikipedia page</a>. What i am going to discuss
  	is how individuals and their networks could form a effective cooperative with whay they have in hand. In the era of Information &
  	Communication technology, form of goods and services are shifting rapidly from physical realm to digital realm. What i have learned is
  	Cooperative philosophy does not provide you a set of success formulas that pushes you in to the sea of hurricanes of business competition,
  	and expect you to succeed, so that a new formula would arise out of your effort. What it provides is a basic set of principles and
  	guidelines that evolves from pragmatic understanding how we human beings can really live as social beings by not falling into the trap
  	of competition and greed.
      </p>
      
    </div>

    <div class="chapter-header"><span>THE TRIUMPH</span></div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
	Wherever i see now, there is a community for everything (especially in tech. world). Not more than 10 years ago, there is barely a community
	and even if it is there it would be around a set of philosophical background and basically serve mutual learning platform - which we usually
	term as clubs. Fast forward 10 years, there is literally a community for every programming language, every technological framework, for every
	skill. This is the case in Urban places, where as in rural areas it is still challenging to have a community apart from local administrative
	councils. Communities are becoming the great place of knowledge sharing & deliberation that spans from technological issues to political issues.
	People in communities have more <mark>networked awareness</mark> about things that are happening around, that atleast enables forming a mindset
	to filter out the noise that we are constantly bogged down with.
      </p>

      <p>
	What if these Networked individuals, who are already grouped together either for sharing knowledge or actively involved in addresing social issues,
	-- could use their skills, tools, knowledge to evolve from communities to <b>networked community-cooperatives</b> ?

  	<ul>
  	  <li>What if they can use the collective effort to address social issues more effectively ?</li>
  	  <li>What if such effort enable them to sustain themselves economically and financially ?</li>
  	  <li>What if such a triumph enables them to live independently - off the corporate or paternal bureaucratic systems ?</li>
  	  <li>What if they represent the living examples and proofs of alternatives ?</li>
  	</ul>
      </p>

      <p>
	Already many communities are successful and stand out as roll models in civil society forms, atleast with the ones i am in touch with.
	They have even participation at times associated with social issue. What i am seeking is a further evolution in communities that
	would use individual skillsets and technologies for addressing social issues or to provide a service for marginalized people and sectors,
	with their collaborative nature.

    <div class="chapter-header"><span>SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE</span></div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
	Folks like me who either become a victim or becoming the instrument of invisible hands that help make others victims will eventually search
	for alternative solution. At emotional level its normative to be stressed out, sick, tired of the current economic system which we would
	bear the manifestation of the effect in psychological or medical conditions. We know for sure, that individuals health and happiness are
	significantly tangled with socio-economic conditions. Thus searching for alternative is a normative social function, which is when
	an individual's awareness about the systems and knowledge around them comes into picture. Without deliberation and analysis, empathizing on
	opinions and ideas would be difficult.
      </p>

      <p>
	Those who understand the tangled interconnections between social, political, economical, cultural systems & practices, polices, decisions does
	always influences other creating a complex system where nothing can be deterministic. But the search for alternative that accept the
	non-deterministic and organic nature of systems and their associations always has continued and will continue. Alternatives, always has
	triggered the historical changes which in turn makes history. Without alternative ideas and systems, we would not be here. There is always a
	frustration potential behind a innovation, a degree of hatred about the state of conditions and things around the one who strives to bring
	the change through that innovation. So, altnerative is a fundamental key.

	      It will not be late before anyone realize that what we were trained to interpret as Education is not at all education, but just a conveyor belt
	      that pushes us forward at constant phase which will eventually makes us a efficient & intelligent assemblers and production maintenance machines.
	      The assembly line needs non-emotional, non-questioning labour that have highly eficient productivity measure. No time is affordable for leisure.

	      Monotonicity in manufacturing, production, marketing, sales, etc... as established by the industrial regime itself has created a climate of
	      dislike and hatred. This is undergoing a sea change currently to change the system of production more perky, enjoyable, entyching, rewarding
	      yet just to feed to emotional part of our brain, to drug it, to numb it and support the popular system in place for stability in operations.
	      Current Education system established in place, does not properly provide us with cognitive instruments and tools to help analyze the situation
	      and its possible outcomes. It just provides us enough to follow others blindly and do stuff to act as a part of the functioning system. It
	      provides us with necessary feelings of chilling and fear, when we desire to do things that are not conventional. It becomes the fences of our
	      own minds. Our thought process are tied. We are blinded by our own fears and established rules.

	    <p>
	      One needs Courage to believe in what they think, to empathize. One needs to be Confident while acting on ideas. Without Courage, Confidence
	      cannot emerge. One need to Critically think, i.e, with non-motivational reasoning. Without Courage & Confidence, Empathy & Critical thinking
	      becomes impossible. This is what actually Education is all about. If the established is not going to (will not) teach it, we will eventually
	      find our own ways to learn it. After all Knowledge depends on Truth. And now we have communities and collaborationn.

	      With our current phase in human history, we have sufficient conditions to bring changes that can be either harmful or useful to all. Deciding
	      our plans and policies wisely lies the real question. Fortunately the way we organize socially and politically have also undergone definitive
	      changes. We have come a long way from subjugative propagation of command and execution to participative and collective action. What we have
	      today is:
	      
	      <ul>
		<li>Community</li>
		<li>Collaboration</li>
		<li>Cooperation</li>
		<li>Communication</li>
	      </ul>	
	    </p>

	    <p>
	      The desperate search for better life and better alternative that provides such life, atleast in theory & with the convience of Information &
	      Communications Technology infrastructure, has lead us to communicate at ease and wish. This provided us with a platform of deliberation
	      and democracy. We organize together to form Communities, help us collaborate on ideas and actions. We being to cooperate with us, without
	      somebody always on top to govern us or subjugate us. We can able to self-organize and self-regulate our decisions. But this can happen with
	      sufficiently smaller number of people. It is hard to be rational when the size of the community becomes larger. Its hard to manage and self-organize.
	      Thus, a diverse number of forums, communities tend to emerge to maintain communication while keeping noise at minimum.

	      I only varied one assumption – the assumption concerning perfect information – and in ways which seemed highly plausible. ...
	      We succeeded in showing not only that the standard theory was not robust – changing only one assumption in ways which were
	      totally plausible had drastic consequences, but also that an alternative robust paradigm with great explanatory power could
	      be constructed. There were other deficiencies in the theory, some of which were closely connected. The standard theory assumed
	      that technology and preferences were fixed. But changes in technology, R & D, are at the heart of capitalism. ... I similarly
	      became increasingly convinced of the inappropriateness of the assumption of fixed preferences.

    One of the beautiful advantages in community is that one shall learn from their peers and the information they share. One such learning
    in out community happened for me, when my peers shared about a structured course material that would help shape our theoretical understanding
    about <mark>Alternative Economic Models,</mark> more than what we have explored and known about. It certainly helped me learning about
    the historical underpinnings for the quest of alternative practices. Flamboyantly, the mentors elucidated numerous proved, proving methods and
    practices adapted guidelines of Cooperative Economics, by different communities distributed throughout the world convering as a self
    sustainable system.

<div class="chapter-header"><span>BOOT A COOP</span></div>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    Invoking a Cooperative practice often is not similar to what a capitalistic regime would do. Unlike, the capitalist model of
    cooperativeness, it is harnessed at the decentralized grass-roots level. The function of cooperative action differ completely
    in both theories. Capitalism contradicts itself with competition and thus uses cooperative structure to monopolize the market
    under one operation. Thus cooperative strategy can either be used for progressive or regressive outcome. It usually involves
    taking care of process to achieve the goal of cooperation. Not only the goal is vital, but also how the process is deviced and
    practiced in a cooperative way is vital.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cooperativism as an alternative to crisis redundant, vicious Capitalism which devour well being and environment required for
    sustaining human life seems attractive. But one has to understand why Capitalism is crumbling around us since its inception.
    As <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz">Joseph Stiglitz</a></b> stated, it was built on numerous
    theoretical assumptions upon assumptions that construct the fundamental foundation of the system. This construction eventually
    struggles, defends, and often gets offensive to stabilize itself from criticism and attacks. Since it is a form and function
    that gets infected in all agents who uses capitalism to derive economic support for life, will eventually become the vangaurds
    of its defense. We also have to accept the fact, that we are in this situation for which capitalism has contributed much in our past.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am learning some of the properties that help construct a pragmatic alternative for such centrally controlled, secretive,
    exploiting, phase of our economic history. A democratic nation most possibly would support the right to form a cooperative
    association, devoid of gender difference. For instance, in our country - India, it has become a fundamental right to initiate
    or be a part of a cooperative or union. This supports the constitutional preamble of economic democracy. Whether we people
    choose to adapt and function is the pragmatic question. While the established economic functioning is mostly mixed and defined
    by free market, state intervention, & financial institutions, it is necessary to know about national, regional and local
    governance, socio-economic conditions to form a rational cooperative association. This means there is <u>no formula</u> as
    usually chased for success in modern capitalistic economy. Its rigor gets more organic and influenced by local conditions
    rather than global and distant conditions.
