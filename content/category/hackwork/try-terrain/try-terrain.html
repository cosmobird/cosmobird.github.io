  	  	<p>
			If one ever understands the relationship between geography, social, cultural, technological, economic
  	  	  	& environmental systems - seems to get to know further about the complexity involved in nature.
  	  	  	Without doubt it has deep entangled connections with the math involved in Geometry, Physics, Chemistry,
  	  	  	Biology. In short, whenever a phenomenon can be represented along with the location involved (<i><a
			href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">that respects heisenberg's uncertainty
			principle</a></i>), the spatiality can be used to visualize and communicate about the phenomenon's
  	  	  	behavior which is scalable from local to global. However, i am not going to discuss something widely
  	  	  	about geography and GIS here (perhaps another article in someother category) - let's delve into how
  	  	  	i have used the <b>open data <i>(public domain)</i></b> to undetstand the topography and how i
  	  	  	further travelled to learn more about it, to analyze, to generate, to visualize, to communicate, & to
  	  	  	share.
  	  	</p>
  	</div>

	<div class="chapter-header"><span>WHAT IS THIS TERRAIN STUFF ?</span></div>

	<div class="content">
  	  	<p>
			One could easily lookup the collaborative authorship definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain"
			>Terrain</a> and might understand clearly what is that all about. It simply means, the very
  	  	  	Earth we live on, practically everything in the planet rooted in or refered with ground. If one could
  	  	  	suck all the water in the planet, and remove all the anthropological builtup above the ground, then
  	  	  	the reamining stuff in the planet - i.e, the <b>physical geography</b> of the remaining surface is
  	  	  	called the terrain of the planet Earth.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
			The coolsome thing about terrain is it provides <b>elevation</b>. Elevation is an important stuff here,
  	  	  	because in physical reality it enables perspective. As terrain is not just about a location alone, but elevation
  	  	  	at that particular location - the information extracted facilitates one to think about what will be the
  	  	  	perspective that it can offer. Terrain mapping is all about profiling the elevation measurement in a location
  	  	  	through survey teams and using survey instruments, projecting the measurement meticulously on the map, and fuse
  	  	  	it with other abstract field data to enrich the explorative and communication aspect of mapping.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	   	Understanding terrain thoroughly requires the knowledge of how is it surveyed, how the elevations are measured,
  	  	   	how is it mapped using cartography and how the information is disseminated and updated then after. For very long
  	  	  	time, the measurement is undergone with Military or Survey authority regulated and adminsitered by Governments of
  	  	  	a country. Still now, hard to reach places are effectively measured by such dedicated Survey Engineers & Technicians.
			This has been particularly influenced by the availability of standards and technology that uses them. With the
  	  	  	evolution of open standards and research communities encouraging open standards in the field of <a href="http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">
			Geographical/Geospatial Information Systems</a> - have paved a way for reducing the fatigue process of mapping into
  	  	  	a more interesting and elegant procedure.
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	Terrain in Cartographic terms are referred as Topographical maps which are further percieved based on the
  	  	  	measurement of elevation relative to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level">mean sea level</a> as :
  	  	  	<ul>
  	  	  	  <li> Hypsometry </li>
  	  	  	  <li> Bathymetry </li>
  	  	  	</ul>

  	  		<figure>
  	  		  	<img style="width:640px" src="../../../../content/resource/drawings/try-terrain/hypso-bathy.png" alt="hypsometry-bathymetry-drawing">
  	  	  		<figcaption>Basic difference between Hypsometry & Bathymetry and how they relate to DEM</figcaption>
  	  		</figure>
  	  	</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	With the advent in Satellite & Remote sensing technology, several explorative & scientific satellite missions have
  	  	  	been launched to facilitate global measurements with diverse goals that would surpass the cost indulged
  	  	  	in lauching the remote sensing project itself. In similar way to create computerized models of elevations
			international research efforts such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission">
			SRTM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Spaceborne_Thermal_Emission_and_Reflection_Radiometer#ASTER_Global_Digital_Elevation_Model">
			ASTER</a> & other satellite missions were launched, to provide the data required for creating the <a href="http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Digital_Elevation_Model">
			Digital Elevation Model (DEM)</a>. Checkout their instrumentation, and are one of the supercooooool integrations
  	  	  	in the scientific, engineering realm... which will surely spike out hairs of DIY instrumentation, communication hackers/researchers
  	  	  	in general.
  	  	</p>

  	  		</figure>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  	With the availability of UAVs, RADAR, SONAR, LIDAR, HyperSpectral based instruments, the data fusion have brought
  	  	  	has very informative and attractive topographical maps which is disseminated to commons use. Even more with the
  	  	  	accessability of Free & Open Source Software tools, technologies & platforms that implement a democratic and open
  	  	  	strandards pur forth by the geo-science community, enables commons to contribute to mapping effectively than ever
  	  	  	before. This strategy not only distributes the information, but also encourages the commons to study about the
  	  	  	mechanisms, policies, scientific principles involved with mapping itself.

					acquired from Satellite, Aerial, UAV, RADAR, LIDAR, Photogrammetry, sources, but also include 3D scanning, SONAR with
					<a href="http://arc-team-open-research.blogspot.in/2016/10/archeorov-open-hardware-rov.html">unmanned Under Water Vehicles/Robots</a>
  					for localized mapping. This breaks the surface mapping limitation, and thus can be used in <a href="http://arc-team-open-research.blogspot.in/2017/01/digitizing-excavation.html">archeological studies too</a>. In such cases, the location is measured by position measurement methods such as dead reckoning, etc.
					Most probably Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) are developed and used to aid data acquisition.

  	  	  	  	  	With the widespread usage of Internet, and accelerated usage of client server model throughout the web mapping
  	  	  	  	  	services like Open street map; Open cycle map; Open topo map; ... etc, have enabled commons to easily contribute
  	  	  	  	  	as a collaborative effort. However, with transition towards grassroots based internet, the ability to serve the
  	  	  	  	  	content/information locally to the locality in a decentralized way or a flat p2p way is a better approach than the
  	  	  	  	  	centralized hierarchically controlled internet based business that restricts access to web map data.

					tileserver-light</a> - by <a href="https://openmaptiles.org/">osmtovector tiles</a> project
  	  	  	  	  	comes to play in place of traditional mapnik based image(png) based web map services with space and presentation
  	  	  	  	  	efficiency that effectively reduces the delay and offers information capacity by hacking the nature of scalable vector
  	  	  	  	  	graphics and the ability of modern web technologies. The end result is a scalable and federated approach to access map,
  	  	  	  	  	which necessarily does not even require continuous internet connection to serve the map, to update the user screen -
  	  	  	  	  	until and unless the new data is itself updated in the collaborative map servers. Already fully p2p capable map sharing
  	  	  	  	  	applications are being developed and would more likely serve in the space of hard to reach & slow internet places,
