  	  	  	If you are expecting some awesome gis stuff here... you might get regretted after knowing that i just
  	  	  	write what i felt sharing... it might be even dumb enough for you.. furthermore, i and this might
  	  	  	feel stupid enough for you ditch it.... :D

			If one ever undetstands the relationship between geography, social, cultural, technological, economic
  	  	  	& environmental systems - seems to get to know further about the complexity involved in nature.
  	  	  	Without doubt it has deep entangled connections with the math involved in Geometry, Physics, Chemistry,
  	  	  	Biology. In short, whenever a phenomenon can be represented along with the location involved (<i> <a
			href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle">that respects heisenberg's uncertainty
			principle</a></i>), the spatiality can be used to visualize and communicate about the phenomenon's
  	  	  	behavior which is scalable from local to global. However, i am not going to discuss something widely
  	  	  	about geography and GIS here (perhaps another article in someother category) - let's delve into how
  	  	  	i have used the <b>open data <i>(public domain)</i></b> to undetstand the topography and how i
  	  	  	further travelled to learn more about it, to analyze, to generate, to visualize, to communicate, & to
  	  	  	share.

			One could easily lookup the collaborative authorship definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain"
			>Terrain</a> and might understand clearly what is that all about. It simply means, the very
  	  	  	Earth we live on, practically everything in the planet rooted in or refered with ground. If one could
  	  	  	suck all the water in the planet, and remove all the anthropological builtup above the ground, then
  	  	  	the reamining stuff in the planet - i.e, the <b>physical geography</b> of the remaining surface is
  	  	  	called the terrain of the planet Earth.
