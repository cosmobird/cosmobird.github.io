		explorers, learners, internetistas, hackers, students, researchers, scholars, & all other crazy commons ... :)
		Some of you might wonder what is this fucking portal here in first place !... Well this is my interface to the
		miserable humans out there who are floating around internet, accidentally stumbled across my site !

is my buddy <b>cosmo</b> here.
</pre>

  	  <p>

		i find it interesting to have a companion to reside in this house instead of living all by myself.

  	    	<ul>
  	    	  <li>for all i know conventional blogging style is not satisfying me.</li>
  	    	  <li>i hate time stamping my stuff. I also do not like to host my stuff in some centralized place,
		  	    which i dont have control over.</li>
  	    	  <li>so, i have restricted myself writing in web in terms of blog or portal for so long time.</li>
  	    	  <li>furthermore, i dont have enough fuel power to provide for the service and thus not becoming
		  	    part of the perpetuating problem.</li>
  	    	</ul>
	</p>

  	<p>
		Why should one has to log - the thoughts that emerge in mind ?
	</p>

  	<p>
		i mean, i remember stuff based not only on time but also based on categories.
		Content organization based on categories is given very less importance in blog space.
		It is also very monotonic to see that the blogs have a monotonic time based structure.
  	  	i felt that is because existing frameworks for whatever reason seems to impose a
  	  	structure for blogging. it eases one to start web log, but with comfort and structures
  	  	comes the price of monotonicity and loss of uniqueness... that is how i feel honestly.
	</p>

  	<p>
		<b>dots are connected with lines formed by time stamps at each dots.</b> it means the blogger
  	  	and the visitor are restricting their rich state of mind to linear nature of thought process
  	  	and fails to even try to explore approaches for knowledge organization. i also do feel, that
  	  	this timing constraint of conventional blog structuring made visitors of the blog expect
  	  	something from the blogger, as if one would expect from a newspaper and other traditional
  	  	electronic media. However, we all know internet, and even the phoenix bird = blogosphere
  	  	is not that.
  	</p>

	<p>
		i like to manage my stuff i.e., sharable knowledge in terms of GRAPH - as in graph theory. Time stamping is a good idea,
		but web logging in terms of time - for me - limits my thought process and communication with the world. So i prioritized
		to design this site in terms of category, and append time only when necessary, for example to notify about new posts,
		articles, interviews, RSS syndication ...

		thus, dots can be connected based on relations between concepts and subject matter.
