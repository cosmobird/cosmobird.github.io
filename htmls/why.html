hi there,

explorers, learners, internetistas, hackers, students, researchers, scholars, & all other crazy ignorants ... :)
Some of you might wonder what is this fucking portal here in first place !... Well this is my interface to the
miserable humans out there who are floating around internet, accidentally stumbled across my site !

By the way,
    <bud>

	is my buddy <b>cosmo</b> here.

i find it interesting to have a companion to reside in this house instead of living all by myself.

	<b>.)</b> for all i know conventional blogging style is not satisfying me.

  	<b>.)</b> i hate time stamping my stuff. I also do not like to host my stuff in some centralized place,
  	    which i dont have control over.

  	<b>.)</b> so, i have restricted myself writing in web in terms of blog or portal for so long time.

  	<b>.)</b> furthermore, i dont have enough fuel power to provide for the service and thus not becoming
  	    part of the perpetuating problem.


Why should one has to log - the thoughts that emerge in mind ?

i mean, i remember stuff based not only on time but also based on categories.
Content organization based on categories is given very less importance in blog space.
It is also very monotonic to see that the blogs have a monotonic time based structure.

dots are connected with lines formed by time stamps at each dots.

		+----------------------------------+

i like to manage my stuff i.e., sharable knowledge in terms of GRAPH - as in graph theory. Time stamping is a good idea,
but web logging in terms of time - for me - limits my thought process and communication with the world. So i prioritized
to design this site in terms of category, and append time only when necessary, for example to notify about new posts,
articles, interviews, RSS syndication ...

thus, dots can be connected based on relations between concepts and subject matter.
