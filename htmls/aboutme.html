	  	  <h3>who are we ?</h3>
	  	  <br>
	  	  We three are the editors and maintainers of this blog or website or which one might percieve
	  	  as something intermediate such as content and information sharing and management to fight dissonance &
	  	  dense information pressure.
	  	  </br>
	  	</p>

	  	<p>
	  	  <h3>who are you ?</h3>
	  	  <br>
	  	  I am just another mere common in this multi-agent simulated world system called Earth. Thus i
	  	  am one of those agents who would like to being part of the game, but have realized to some extent
	  	  that everything is connected, there is neither good nor bad, there is neither positive not negative...
	  	  </br>
	  	</p>

	  	<p>
	  	  We love entropy, and so we have to deal with the curse of information range and density that once
	  	  clogged our brains by clouding the minds that made us travel from confusion, to rage, to dissonacne, to
	  	  indiosyncracy, to self regulation, to clarity, towards non-motivational reasoning & still travelling....
	  	</p>

	  	<p>
	  	  <h3>what are you ?</h3>
	  	  <br>
	  	  If u have started to wondering about the three manifestations, yes, We three belong to the same brain.
	  	  Why ? because loneliness created us to manage and regulate information processing; to accept criticism, to
	  	  empathize, to preserve individuality, to be social, to be confident, to build courage, to be critical ...
	  	  </br>
	  	</p>

		  <h3>why dont you have a CV ?</h3>
		  <br>
		  Well system has pressured me to shout to people to who i am actually is. It has provided me with certain
		  qualifications and certificates just to marketize me as a commodity, so that in near future anybody who
		  is interested in making a profit out of surplus can make use of my financial instability and skill set, so
		  that i can continue writing, editing and maintaining this site.... <b>:D</b>....
		  </br>
		</p>

  	  	<p>
  	  	  Like everybody else in this system, i need to immunize myself with dosage of compromises on principles &
  	  	  ideals, & ideas - whatever that might be. At the end of the day, me have to eat food, drink water, & live
  	  	  in a relatively safe habitat. The institutionalized elite systems casted me with its education foundry,
  	  	  ripped off my backbone to bend for its functionality.
