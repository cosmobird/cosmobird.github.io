	  	  <h3>who are we ?</h3>
	  	</p>
  	  	<p>
	  	  We three are the editors and maintainers of this blog or website or which one might percieve
	  	  as something intermediate such as content and information sharing and management to fight dissonance &
	  	  dense information pressure.
	  	</p>

	  	<p>
	  	  <h3>who am i ?</h3>
	  	</p>
  	  	<p>
	  	  I am just another mere common in this multi-agent simulated world system called Earth. Thus i
	  	  am one of those agents who would like to being part of the game, but have realized to some extent
	  	  that everything is connected, there is neither good nor bad, there is neither positive nor negative...
	  	  and have decided to play from the progressive side. I often displace myself away from this circus,
	  	  take a seat and try to <b>see, observe</b> rather than just looking at it. In the process i naturally
	  	  learn.
		</p>
  	  	<p>
	  	  I often felt so fortunate to have great parents, friends & peers who have constantly supported me
	  	  economically and morally. Even though most of us are blinded by curtain and carpets of ignorance,
	  	  i could not ignore their love for me. Furthermore, who am i to judge and fit them to a particular
	  	  characteristic ? Humans are generally passionate and helpful, even when we think ourselves as highly
	  	  sophisticated social civilizations - while research and reality say otherwise... :)
	  	</p>
	  	<p>
	  	  We three love entropy, and so we have to deal with the curse of information range and density that once
	  	  clogged the brain by clouding the minds that made us travel from confusion, to rage, to dissonacne, to
	  	  indiosyncracy, to self regulation, to clarity, towards non-motivational reasoning & still travelling....
	  	</p>

	  	<p>
	  	  <h3>what am i ?</h3>
	  	</p>
		<p>
	  	  If u have started to wondering about the three manifestations, yes, We three belong to the same brain.
	  	  Why ? because loneliness created us to manage and regulate information processing; to accept criticism, to
	  	  empathize, to preserve individuality, to be social, to be confident, to build courage, to be critical ...
	  	</p>

		<p>
		  <h3>Is this my CV ?</h3>
		</p>
		<p>
		  Well system has pressured me to shout to people to who i am actually is. It has provided me with certain
		  qualifications and certificates just to marketize me as a commodity, so that in near future anybody who
		  is interested in making a profit out of surplus can make use of my financial instability and skill set, so
		  that i could continue my hobby, passion, writing, editing and maintaining this site.... <b>:D</b> in the
		  remaining time.
		</p>
  	  	<p>
  	  	  Like everybody else in this system, i need to immunize myself with dosage of compromises on principles &
  	  	  ideals, & ideas - whatever that might be. At the end of the day, me have to eat food, drink water, & live
  	  	  in a relatively safe habitat. The institutionalized elite systems casted me with its education foundry,
  	  	  ripped off my backbone to bend for its functionality.
  	  	</p>
